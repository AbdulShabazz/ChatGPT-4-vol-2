**Q:** Does Unreal Engine have a builtin screen recorder for its game viewport?

**A:** Unreal Engine does not have a built-in screen recorder for the game viewport. However, it provides several alternatives for capturing gameplay or rendering high-quality sequences. Here are the primary options available:

### 1. Movie Render Queue

*	**Purpose:** The Movie Render Queue is designed for high-quality, offline rendering of cinematic sequences within Unreal Engine.
*	**Features:**
*	**Output:** Supports exporting frames as individual image sequences (e.g., PNG, EXR) or video formats.
*	**Settings:** Allows custom resolutions, anti-aliasing options, and advanced post-processing settings for rendering high-fidelity frames.
*	**Uses:** Ideal for capturing cinematic sequences or high-quality renders for film, animation, and advertisements.

### 2. Sequencer Tool

*	**Purpose:** The Sequencer is Unreal Engine’s non-linear editing tool for creating and recording in-game cinematic sequences.
*	**Features:**
*	**Animation Recording:** Records character animation, camera movements, and scene changes.
*	**Render Output:** You can render the recorded sequences using the Movie Render Queue for higher quality or directly within the Sequencer for faster playback output.
*	**Playback:** Offers real-time playback for previewing animations.

### 3. Third-Party Screen Recording Tools

*	**Recommendation:** For real-time game viewport recording (e.g., capturing gameplay as you play), you would typically rely on external screen recording tools, such as:
*	**OBS Studio:** Open-source software for real-time screen capture.
*	**NVIDIA ShadowPlay:** Built into NVIDIA’s graphics drivers, supports capturing gameplay with minimal performance impact.
*	**Windows Game Bar:** For basic screen recording on Windows systems.

### 4. HighResShot Command

*	**Purpose:** For capturing high-resolution screenshots, Unreal Engine provides the HighResShot command.
*	**Usage:**
*	**Command line:** HighResShot <resolution_multiplier>.
*	**Example:** HighResShot 2 captures a screenshot at twice the current resolution.
*	**Limitations:** This is for still images, not video capture.

### 5. Take Recorder

*	**Purpose:** Designed to record gameplay or in-editor action into assets that can later be rendered through the Movie Render Queue.
*	**Features:**
*	**Gameplay Capture:** Captures in-game events, actor movement, and camera shots into reusable tracks.
*	**Animation:** Can be used to record animation and sequences that are triggered by gameplay.

For simple video recordings of your game viewport, a third-party recording tool like OBS Studio is usually more appropriate, especially if real-time performance and ease of use are priorities.

**Q:** How can I record gameplay with Sequencer Tool if at all possible?

**A:** Recording gameplay using the **Sequencer Tool** in Unreal Engine is possible, and it allows you to capture gameplay events, animations, and camera movements. However, the Sequencer is primarily designed for cinematic creation, so it involves a few additional steps to record gameplay as compared to using a simple screen recording tool.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to record gameplay with the Sequencer Tool:

**Step 1: Create a New Sequence**

**1.	Open the Unreal Editor.**
**2.	Create a new Level Sequence:**
* Go to the **Cinematics** tab on the top toolbar.
*	Select **Add Level Sequence**.
*	Choose a name and location for the new sequence file.

**Step 2: Set Up Your Camera for Recording**

**1.	Add a Camera:**
*	Inside the Sequencer window, click the + Track button.
*	Choose Camera Cuts Track.
*	Click the + Camera icon next to the Camera Cuts Track to add a new camera or select an existing one from the level.
*	This camera will be used to record the gameplay view.
**2.	Position and Preview the Camera:**
*	Select the camera in the level and adjust its position to capture the right perspective for your gameplay.
*	Use the Pilot Camera feature (right-click on the camera and select Pilot) to follow the camera view and see how the game looks through it.

**Step 3: Add Gameplay Elements (Optional)**

If you want to record specific actors or gameplay elements as part of the cinematic:

**1.	Add Actors to the Sequencer:**
*	In the **Sequencer**, click + Track, and then choose Actor to Sequencer.
*	Select the gameplay actors or elements you wish to include in the sequence.
**2.	Record Gameplay Animation (Optional):**
*	If your game has custom character animations, you can record their movements by creating keyframes within the Sequencer for added control.

**Step 4: Record Gameplay in Real Time**

If you want to capture gameplay events (like player movement or interaction) in real time:

**1.	Use Take Recorder:**
*	Unreal Engine’s **Take Recorder** tool allows you to capture real-time gameplay events into assets that can be inserted into a **Sequencer**.
*	Navigate to **Window > Cinematics > Take Recorder.**
*	In the **Take Recorder** panel, click **+ Source** and select the actors or components you want to record (e.g., your character, camera, etc.).
*	Set up the recording options such as the directory, naming convention, and frame rate.
*	Click **Record** when you’re ready to play and capture the gameplay events.
*	After recording, you can drag the recorded “Take” into the **Sequencer** for further editing.

**Step 5: Add Keyframes and Adjust Timeline (Optional)**

  1.	**Adjust Tracks:** You can manually add keyframes to control camera movements, actor positions, and other elements along the Sequencer timeline.
  2.  **Timing Adjustments:** Fine-tune when certain events occur within the sequence, such as when an animation plays or when the camera cuts between different views.  

**Step 6: Render the Sequence**

  1. Once your gameplay and camera movements are recorded, you can render the sequence as a video.  
  2.	**Open the Movie Render Queue:**  
* Go to **Cinematics > Movie Render Queue.**
*	Click **+ Render** and select the **Level Sequence** you just created.
  3.	**Render Settings:**  
*	Choose the desired output settings (resolution, frame rate, file format).
*	You can also enable advanced rendering features such as anti-aliasing, post-processing, or motion blur to improve the final output quality.
  4.	**Render Output:**
*	Click **Render** to start rendering the gameplay video.

**Summary of Tools Involved**

*	**Sequencer:** To create and control cinematics, including adding cameras, gameplay elements, and actors.
*	**Take Recorder:** To record gameplay events and player interactions in real-time and add them to the Sequencer.
*	**Movie Render Queue:** To render the final sequence as a video file in high quality.

**Additional Tips**

*	For simple gameplay capture without heavy editing, using Take Recorder and combining it with the Movie Render Queue would be more straightforward than manually adding keyframes in the Sequencer.
*	You can also combine Cinematic Cameras with recorded gameplay to create highly polished sequences, perfect for trailers, gameplay demonstrations, or in-game cutscenes.

By using this approach, Unreal Engine allows a great deal of control over the final rendered output, making it suitable for both gameplay recordings and cinematic sequences.
