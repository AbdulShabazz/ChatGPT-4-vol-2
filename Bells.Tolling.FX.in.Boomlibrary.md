## OpenAI ChatGPT v1.2025.330 Bells.Tolling.Boomlibrary.md

**Q: Which boomlibrary plugins has bells tolling?**

**A:** Short answer: none of BOOM’s *software plug-ins* are “bell instruments” – the tolling bells are in their *sound effect libraries*, not in the plug-ins themselves.

If you want actual bell tolls (church / cathedral, clock tower, ambience), these BOOM libraries have them:

1. Medieval Life (Construction Kit + Designed)
   – Explicit church/cathedral bell tolls, single strikes, and ambiences with bells in town squares. ([BOOM Library][1])
   – Metadata includes files like “Cathedral Bells Full Peal / Pre Peal / Salve Regina” described as large church bells ringing and slowly tolling.

2. BOOM ONE (General SFX library) – “Holy Magic & Bells” update
   – BOOM ONE itself is a giant general library; the 2025-01 content update “Holy Magic & Bells” adds >400 files / ~2000 sounds focused on bells, including designed bells and hand-bell recordings, which can easily be used as tolls or layered into tolling sequences. ([BOOM Library][2])

3. Medieval / European ambience libraries with bells in the background
   – Medieval Life again (marketplace / town square ambiences with church bells in the distance). ([BOOM Library][3])
   – Urban & Suburban / Urban Europe include city ambiences with bells as part of the environment (less isolated, more ambience-style tolling). ([BOOM Library][4])

4. Stylized / horror / magic bell-type content
   – Cinematic Horror (Construction Kit & Designed): includes door bells, cowbells, and “church bell–like” tonal metal hits that can function as stylized tolls in horror/trailer contexts. ([BOOM Library][5])
   – Magic / Magic Wisp / Magic Alchemy lines: layered and designed bells, chimes, and bell-like elements for magical UI and spells rather than realistic church towers. ([BOOM Library][6])

BOOM software plug-ins list (Rain, Stereolab, Uberloud, Enrage, Enforcer, LiftFX, SoundWeaver, Turbine, Recenter, Debird, Grip) are all processors/generators; they don’t ship as “bell libraries” themselves. ([BOOM Library][7])

If you tell me whether you want:
– realistic church/cathedral tolls,
– clock-tower / city ambience, or
– stylized/horror/magic tolls,

I can narrow this down to a single best BOOM product and suggest a workflow (e.g., which library + which BOOM plug-in chain to process them).
