**Q:** C++ is a compiled programming language but is it possible to create an interpreted version ? The goal being to realize the common benefits of an interpreted language such as faster prototyping but while retaining control of the c++ source and thus its compiled output results...

**A:** Yes, it is possible to create an interpreted version of C++ to gain the benefits of faster prototyping while retaining control over the source code and its compiled outputs. While C++ is traditionally a compiled language, several tools and projects have been developed to interpret or provide interactive execution environments for C++ code.

### **Cling: An Interactive C++ Interpreter**

One of the most prominent tools is **Cling**, an interactive C++ interpreter built on top of the **Clang** and **LLVM** compiler infrastructure. Cling allows you to write and execute C++ code interactively, much like a Python or MATLAB REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). Here's how Cling can help:

- **Immediate Feedback**: Execute code snippets and see results instantly without the compile-link-run cycle.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Test functions, classes, and algorithms on the fly.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Experiment with new ideas in a live environment.
- **Learning and Teaching**: Useful for educational purposes to demonstrate concepts interactively.

**Example Usage of Cling:**

```bash
$ cling
[cling]$ #include <iostream>
[cling]$ std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
Hello, World!
```

### **Advantages of Using an Interpreted Environment for C++**

- **Faster Development Cycle**: Eliminates the need for repetitive compilation, speeding up the development process.
- **Flexibility**: Modify and test code in real-time.
- **Access to Compiled Output**: Since Cling uses the Clang compiler, you retain control over the compilation process and can generate optimized code when needed.

### **Other Tools and Approaches**

- **CINT**: An older C++ interpreter that was widely used but has been largely superseded by Cling.
- **Incremental Compilation**: Modern IDEs and build systems support incremental builds, reducing compilation times.
- **Scripting with C++ Syntax**: Tools like **Ch** interpret C++ scripts and can be used for tasks that benefit from both scripting and C++ performance.

### **Limitations to Consider**

- **Performance**: Interpreted execution may not match the performance of fully compiled code.
- **Language Support**: Some advanced or newer C++ features might not be fully supported in the interpreter.
- **Dependencies**: Interpreted environments may have limitations with external libraries or require specific configurations.

### **Alternative Strategies**

- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: Utilize JIT compilation techniques to compile code at runtime, balancing between interpretation and compilation.
- **Embedded Scripting Languages**: Incorporate scripting languages like Python or Lua into your C++ application for rapid prototyping of specific components.
- **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)**: Create or use DSLs designed for rapid development within a specific domain, which can interoperate with C++ code.

### **Conclusion**

Creating an interpreted version of C++ is feasible and can significantly enhance your development workflow by combining the efficiency of interpreted languages with the power and control of C++. Tools like Cling offer a practical solution for interactive C++ development, enabling faster prototyping while maintaining access to the underlying compiled code.
