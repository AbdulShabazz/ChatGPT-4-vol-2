**Q:** Are Avid DNxHD and Apple ProRes supported upload formats in Youtube?

**A:** Yes, both Avid DNxHD and Apple ProRes are supported upload formats on YouTube. YouTube accepts a variety of professional video formats to ensure high-quality uploads. Here’s an overview:

* **Apple ProRes**: Supported, as it is a widely used intermediate codec, especially in professional video editing workflows. YouTube accepts ProRes files, including **ProRes 422** and **ProRes 4444** variants.
* **Avid DNxHD**: Also supported, as it is commonly used in professional editing environments, especially with Avid Media Composer. YouTube can process DNxHD files during the upload.

For optimal quality, however, YouTube recommends using certain **H.264** settings for videos intended for streaming, but both ProRes and DNxHD will be re-encoded by YouTube after upload, preserving the high quality of the original format during the process.
