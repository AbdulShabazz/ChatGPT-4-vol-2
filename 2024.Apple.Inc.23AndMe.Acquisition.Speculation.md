**Q:** Is Apple Inc. a likely candidate to purchase the failing 23AndMe business. The addition of DNA data with consumer health data could make a data breach very lucrative for compromised Apple employees to release onto the Open- and Black Market, if they can convince the Apple CEO to purchase the company.

**A:** As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there were no public indications that Apple Inc. planned to purchase 23andMe. 23andMe is a biotechnology company specializing in genetic testing and research, offering direct-to-consumer DNA testing services. While Apple has shown interest in health and wellness through products like the Apple Watch and Health app, any potential acquisition of 23andMe would be speculative without official announcements.

Both Apple and 23andMe place a strong emphasis on user privacy and data security. If such an acquisition were to occur, it's reasonable to expect that stringent measures would be implemented to protect sensitive genetic and health data from unauthorized access or breaches. Data security is a critical concern for companies handling personal information, and significant efforts are made to safeguard this data.

For the most recent information on this topic, I recommend checking the latest news sources or official statements from the companies involved.
