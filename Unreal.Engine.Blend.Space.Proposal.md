## Proposal: Support for Multiple Window Tabs in the Unreal Engine Blendspace Editor with Coordinated Parameters and Inference Engine

### Overview

This proposal outlines the benefits and technical feasibility of introducing multiple window tabs in the Unreal Engine Blendspace Editor. Each tab would coordinate pairs of parameters, while an **inference engine** would manage the relationships between parameters in the background. The goal of this feature is to improve usability and efficiency, allowing developers to focus on specific sets of parameters while the inference engine handles unedited or unseen tabs, automatically filling in gaps to ensure smooth transitions and consistent animation blending across multiple dimensions.

### Motivation

The current Blendspace Editor in Unreal Engine offers limited support for multidimensional animation blending, typically restricted to blending based on two parameters at a time (X and Y axes). However, modern animation systems often require blending across more than two parameters, such as:

*	**Speed**
*	**Direction**
*	**Player Stance**
*	**Weapon Handling**
*	**Environment Factors (e.g., terrain type)**

Handling these additional parameters within the confines of the current Blendspace system can be challenging, leading to inefficient workflows and difficulty in managing complex animation systems.

### Key Challenges with the Current Blendspace Editor:

*	**Limited Parameter Control:** The editor restricts users to blending based on only two parameters simultaneously, making it difficult to coordinate multiple factors affecting character animation.
*	**Manual Transitions:** Developers must manually adjust animations for unseen or unedited parameter combinations, leading to inconsistencies and gaps in animation transitions.
*	**Increased Complexity for Larger Projects:** Projects with complex animations require frequent switching between different Blendspaces or parameter sets, complicating workflows and increasing the time required to set up animations.

### Proposed Solution

**1. Multiple Window Tabs for Parameter Pairs**

We propose the introduction of multiple window tabs in the Blendspace Editor, each focusing on an overlapping **pair of parameters** (e.g., Speed vs. Direction, and Speed vs. Stance, and etc.). Each tab would allow users to visualize and edit the blending of animations based on the selected parameter pair.

*	**Tab 1:** Speed (X-Axis) vs. Direction (Y-Axis)
*	**Tab 2:** Speed (X-Axis) vs. Player Stance (Y-Axis)
*	**Tab 3:** Direction (X-Axis) vs. Player Stance (Y-Axis)

This multi-tab system would allow users to easily switch between parameter sets without losing context, improving workflow efficiency by enabling focused editing of specific parameter combinations.

**2. Inference Engine for Coordinated Parameter Blending**

An **inference engine** would operate in the background to coordinate between the different tabs. This engine would infer the behavior of unseen or unedited tabs based on the developer’s inputs in the visible tabs. By analyzing the relationships between edited parameters, the engine would predict and fill in gaps for unedited combinations, reducing the need for manual intervention.

*	**Example:** If the user adjusts blending between Speed and Direction, the inference engine would automatically adjust blending in the unseen Speed vs. Stance tab, ensuring consistency without requiring additional manual editing.

The inference engine could be implemented using machine learning or rule-based logic to model parameter relationships and predict transitions for unseen combinations. Developers would have the option to override inferred results when necessary.

**3. Dynamic Tab Coordination**

Each tab would be **dynamically linked** to the others, meaning changes in one tab would propagate to other tabs through the inference engine. For example, adjusting the transition between Speed and Direction would automatically influence the transition between Speed and Player Stance, maintaining coherent blending across all parameters.

This coordinated approach reduces the risk of animation artifacts or inconsistencies caused by independent changes in different parameter pairs. The system would prioritize user-defined transitions, ensuring that manually edited tabs always take precedence over inferred results.

**4. Visual Feedback and Conflict Resolution**

To assist developers in managing complex animations, the system would provide real-time visual feedback on how changes in one tab affect other parameter combinations. If the inference engine encounters conflicting transitions between parameters, the editor would display warnings and offer suggestions for resolving the conflicts.

*	**Example:** If the blending between Speed and Direction conflicts with the blending between Speed and Stance, the system would alert the user and provide options to adjust either or both transitions.

**5. User Control and Overrides**

Developers would retain full control over the Blendspace Editor, with the ability to manually adjust transitions for any parameter pair at any time. The system would offer override options, allowing users to disable the inference engine for specific tabs or parameters if desired.

*	**Manual Editing Mode:** A toggle option to disable automatic inference for developers who prefer full manual control.
*	**Inference Overrides:** Developers can choose to override the inferred results on a tab-by-tab basis, maintaining control over the final blending outcome.

### Benefits of the Proposed System

**1. Increased Efficiency in Animation Setup**

*	The multi-tab system allows developers to focus on specific parameter pairs, reducing the need to juggle multiple animations simultaneously. The inference engine reduces manual work, automatically filling in gaps between parameter combinations.

**2. Improved Consistency Across Animations**

*	By coordinating parameter transitions through an inference engine, the system ensures that animations remain consistent across all dimensions, reducing the risk of artifacts or disjointed transitions.

**3. Enhanced Usability for Complex Projects**

*	For large projects with complex animation requirements, the multi-tab system offers a more manageable and scalable solution. Developers can work in stages, adjusting specific parameter combinations without losing sight of the broader animation framework.

**4. Flexibility and Customization**

*	The system offers flexibility, allowing developers to retain full manual control when necessary while still benefiting from automated inferences. This hybrid approach supports both efficiency and customization.

**5. Scalable to Multiple Dimensions**

*	As the system is designed to handle multiple pairs of parameters, it can easily scale to accommodate additional parameters (e.g., environmental factors, weapon types), making it suitable for games with intricate character movement or environmental interactions.

### Technical Considerations

**1. Integration with Existing Systems**

*	The proposed multi-tab system and inference engine would integrate with the existing Blendspace Editor and Animation Blueprint systems in Unreal Engine. Minimal changes would be required to the core architecture, as the system would primarily operate as an extension to existing functionality.

**2. Performance**

*	The inference engine must be optimized for performance to ensure real-time responsiveness during editing. This could be achieved by implementing lightweight machine learning algorithms or rule-based systems that operate efficiently on common game parameters like Speed, Direction, and Stance.

**3. Compatibility**

* The system would need to maintain compatibility with existing Blendspace projects. Developers should be able to migrate current animations into the multi-tab system without breaking their projects. Backward compatibility will be a priority.

### Conclusion

The introduction of **multiple window tabs** in the Blendspace Editor, coordinated by an **inference engine**, would significantly improve the usability and efficiency of the animation blending workflow in Unreal Engine. By allowing developers to focus on specific parameter pairs and automating the coordination of unedited or unseen tabs, this system offers a scalable, user-friendly solution for managing complex animations. The proposed solution tries to strike a balance between **manual control** and **automated efficiency**, in lieu of for example blend state transition graphs, making it an ideal enhancement for current large, multidimensional animation systems.
