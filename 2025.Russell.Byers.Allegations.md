**Q: What has Russell Buyers alleged?**

**A:** Russell **Byers** (often misspelled “Buyers”) told investigators that he was offered money to have Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. killed.

Specifically, in sworn testimony to the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978, Russell George Byers stated that in about spring 1967:

* An associate, John Kauffmann, asked if he wanted to earn **$50,000**.
* Kauffmann took him to meet St. Louis lawyer **Jack Sutherland**.
* Byers testified that Sutherland offered him **$50,000 to “arrange to murder Martin Luther King”**, saying the money would come from a “secret southern organization” that could raise the funds.
* Byers said he **declined the offer**. ([Internet Archive][1])

Those are the core allegations attributed to Byers in the historical record.
