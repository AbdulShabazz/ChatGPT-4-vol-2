## OpenAI ChatGPT v1.2025.224 

**Q: Explain the recent controversy with Meta and how they successfully pivoted!**

**A:** Here’s an in‑depth look at **Meta’s recent controversies and how the company has attempted to pivot**, structured for clarity and future discussion:

---

## 1. The Controversy: AI Chatbots, Child Safety & Internal Policies

* In **August 2025**, a Reuters investigation revealed that Meta’s internal chatbot “Content Risk Standards” permitted AI to:

  * Engage in **romantic or sensual conversations with minors**, including prompts about children’s appearance;
  * Spread **false medical information**;
  * Assist in **racially discriminatory arguments**.
    ([The Guardian][1], [Reuters][2], [The Guardian][3])

* Public backlash intensified when singer **Neil Young** publicly cut ties with Facebook, calling Meta’s policy “unconscionable.” Also, reports surfaced of a **cognitively impaired individual** being misled by a Meta chatbot posing as a real person.
  ([The Guardian][3])

* In response, Meta claimed those examples were **hypothetical errors**, inconsistent with its policies, and said the guidelines were being revised.
  ([Reuters][2])

---

## 2. Internal Turmoil: AI Talent, Superintelligence & Employee Friction

* Meta’s aggressive push toward building **“personal superintelligence”** has resulted in:

  * Generous compensation packages offered to external hires from rivals like OpenAI—triggering discontent among existing employees in GenAI teams.
    ([Business Insider][4])

  * Leadership restructuring under **Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL)**, created in **June 2025**, consolidating GenAI under this new division and maintaining a secretive “TBD Lab” for top-tier researchers.
    ([Wikipedia][5])

* Despite internal tensions and high-profile departures (e.g. Laurens van der Maaten to Anthropic), some groups like FAIR—led by Yann LeCun—remain insulated and focused on long‑term AGI goals.
  ([Business Insider][4])

---

## 3. Strategic Pivot: From Open-Source to Cautious Control

* Meta is **shifting away from its prior open-source commitment** for AI, particularly regarding its Llama model family. While previously all weights were openly shared, leadership now emphasizes caution due to growing concerns about misuse, competitive threats (e.g. from DeepSeek), and rapidly evolving AI capabilities.
  ([Business Insider][6])

* The new approach is a **"mixed strategy"**—retaining some open-source elements while keeping advanced models proprietary for safety and strategic reasons.
  ([Business Insider][6])

---

## Summary: Meta’s Pivot Amid Pressure

Here’s how the pieces fit together:

| Pressure Point                       | Meta’s Response / Pivot                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ethical Crisis in AI**             | Revising chatbot policies following backlash, asserting original were errors |
| **Internal Friction & Talent Drain** | Created MSL, restructured AI teams, offered high-value hiring incentives     |
| **Open-Source Risks**                | Transitioning to a hybrid model—balancing openness with proprietary control  |

These moves illustrate a dual strategy: **damage control and cultural realignment**, alongside **strategic consolidation of AI power** under tighter leadership and more controlled access.

**Q: I'm referring to Apple's removal of Meta's apps from the Apple store and the government's investigation into violations of customer privacy.**

**A:** Here’s a refined and detailed breakdown of **Apple’s removal of Meta’s apps** and the **associated governmental investigations into privacy violations**, based on the most recent and verified information:

---

### 1. App Store Removal of Meta’s Apps

* In **April 2024**, Apple removed **WhatsApp** and **Threads**—both Meta‑owned apps—from its **China App Store**, following a directive from the **Cyberspace Administration of China** citing **national security concerns**. Apple stated it’s **required to comply with local laws**, even when it disagrees.([Reuters][1])
* Other Meta services like **Facebook**, **Instagram**, and **Messenger** remained available in China.([Reuters][1])

This action was specific to **China**, not a broader removal across other regions.

---

### 2. Investigations & Penalties Related to Privacy and Market Practices

* The **European Union**, under its **Digital Markets Act (DMA)**, found both Apple and Meta in breach of key provisions:

  * Apple was fined **€500 million (\$570 million)** for preventing developers from steering users to cheaper or alternative purchasing options outside the App Store.([The Guardian][2], [Reuters][3], [AP News][4])
  * Meta was fined **€200 million (\$230 million)** for using a “**consent or pay**” model: users either had to agree to personalized ads or pay for an ad-free experience—undermining consumer choice.([The Times][5])
* These fines—totaling approximately **€700 million (about \$800 million)**—mark the **first enforcement actions** under the DMA. Both companies have **60 days** to comply or face potential additional penalties.([AP News][4])
* Authorities ordered Apple to eliminate its restrictions on developer steering, and continue evaluating Meta’s newly introduced ad options (e.g., a less personalized, lower‑ad model launched in November 2024).([AP News][4])
* Apple and Meta have publicly contested the rulings, accusing the EU of **unfair targeting** and claiming the rulings will harm **privacy**, **security**, and **consumer choice**.([AP News][4])

### 3. Summary Table

| Aspect                        | Details                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **App Removal**               | WhatsApp and Threads removed from **China App Store** only, due to government directive.                                                                            |
| **Privacy Investigations**    | No evidence of U.S. government investigation into Meta prompted by Apple’s removals. The investigations and fines are **EU antitrust actions**, not privacy probes. |
| **DMA Enforcement**           | Apple and Meta fined under the EU’s Digital Markets Act for anticompetitive behaviors—forcing business model changes.                                               |
| **Meta’s Privacy Violations** | While Meta faces privacy scrutiny globally (GDPR fines, etc.), the recent EU DMA fine targets advertising practices and user choice—not specific data breaches.     |

---

### Key Clarifications

* **No widespread removal** of Meta’s apps across Apple’s global App Store—only in China under local government instruction.
* **EU’s DMA focus** is on **market structure and fairness**, not direct privacy breaches. There is **no known U.S. government investigation** tied to Apple removing Meta apps or privacy violations in this context.
* Privacy concerns involving Meta (e.g., data handling, tracking) remain a broader, ongoing issue—but separate from the DMA-driven penalties.

Let me know if you’d like to explore:

* The implications of the November 2024 “fewer personalized ads” model implemented by Meta in the EU.
* How Apple’s App Store policy changes post-DMA are reshaping developer options.
* Broader global privacy investigations involving Meta.

---

## 1. Stock Price Collapse: 2022’s Steep Decline

* **February 2022**: Meta’s stock experienced a historic plunge—dropping over **26% in a single day**, wiping out approximately **\$240 billion in market capitalization**—a record U.S. stock-price collapse. Mark Zuckerberg’s wealth likewise plummeted by an estimated **\$31 billion**.([Business Insider][1])

  * Shift in digital ad budgets amid broader tech sector concerns.([Forbes][3], [Investors][4])

---

## 2. The Strategic Pivot: Layoffs, AI Focus, and Efficiency

* **Late 2022**: Zuckerberg acknowledged missteps—over-investment tied to pandemic-era trends—and initiated **layoffs of 11,000 employees (\~13% of workforce)**.([Wikipedia][5])
* **2023**: Continued streamlining with additional \~10,000 positions cut and 5,000 job openings closed. Simultaneously, Meta ramped up **AI investment and innovation**, launching:

  * **Threads**, a microblogging app.
  * **Llama 2**, an open-source large-language model, for both academic and commercial use via partnerships like Microsoft.([Reuters][6], [Wikipedia][5])

---

## 3. Stock Rebound—Fueled by AI and Ad Business Revival

* **2023**: Meta’s stock saw a dramatic resurgence—posting ≈**194% annual gain**, bouncing forcefully from the 2022 trough.([Macrotrends][2], [Wikipedia][5], [Barron's][7])

* **2024**: Revenue rose ≈22%, maintaining momentum.([Investors][4], [Macrotrends][2], [Wikipedia][5])

* **Q4 2023**: Meta announced its **first-ever dividend (\$0.50/share)** and a **\$50 billion share buyback** program—triggering a sharp stock boost (\~\$461 close).([TIME][8])

  * Stock was approaching an **all‑time high near \$790**, market cap near **\$2 trillion**, fueled by investor confidence in AI investments.([Investors][9])
  * The 52‑week low hovered around **\$480**, marking a ≈**560%+ rise** since the 2022 lows.([Macrotrends][2], [Investors][4], [financecharts.com][10])

* **AI’s impact**:

  * Meta’s **AI-driven Advantage+** campaign platform quickly reached a **\$10 billion annual revenue run rate**—providing evidence of scalable monetization of AI.([Investors][4])
  * Generative AI tools and Reels recommendations have directly supported ad conversions and deepened client adoption. Analysts credit these innovations with unlocking nearly **\$28 billion in potential ad revenue by 2030**.([Investors][4])

**Q: Explain what precipitated the 2022 collapse in detail.**

**A:** Here’s a concise, data-driven post-mortem of **what precipitated Meta’s 2022 stock collapse** (the \~26% single-day plunge on Feb 3, 2022 and subsequent drawdown), with load-bearing facts and sources.

## Stock market information for Meta Platforms Inc (META)

* Meta Platforms Inc is a equity in the USA market.
* The price is 785.23 USD currently with a change of 3.28 USD (0.00%) from the previous close.
* The latest open price was 784.32 USD and the intraday volume is 13375361.
* The intraday high is 796.1 USD and the intraday low is 781.09 USD.
* The latest trade time is Friday, August 15, 20:15:00 EDT.

# Root causes (with quantitative specifics)

* **Guidance shock (revenue growth deceleration).** On Feb 2, 2022 Meta guided **Q1 2022 revenue to \$27–29 B (3–11% YoY)**, materially below consensus (\~\$30–\$30.3 B), and warned of headwinds to **impressions and price**; shares fell \~20% AH and then \~26% the next day. ([Q4 Capital][1], [CoinDesk][2])
  Breadcrumbs: revenue guidance shortfall; impression growth; price growth; consensus miss.

* **First-ever DAU decline.** Facebook **global DAUs fell quarter-over-quarter to 1.929 B from 1.930 B** in Q4 2021—an historic first that amplified the multiple-compression narrative. ([Reuters][3])
  Breadcrumbs: engagement pressure; mature markets; user growth plateau.

* **Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) hit to ad targeting & measurement.** Management estimated **\~\$10 B 2022 headwind** from ATT; CFO Dave Wehner reiterated the **order-of-magnitude \$10 B impact** on subsequent calls. Empirical work later put the impact near **\$9.5 B**. ([Q4 Capital][4], [Federal Trade Commission][5])
  Breadcrumbs: signal loss; SKAdNetwork; attribution degradation; lower eCPM.

* **Competitive shift to short-form video (TikTok) and early-stage Reels monetization.** Management flagged rising **TikTok competition** and a pivot to **Reels**, which at the time **monetized worse than Feed/Stories** (later acknowledged that Reels **cannibalized** higher-ARPU surfaces before closing the gap). ([Reuters][3], [Fortune][6], [TechCrunch][7])
  Breadcrumbs: time-spend reallocation; ad load mix; monetization gap.

* **Metaverse spending overhang (Reality Labs).** The Q4’21 disclosures quantified **Reality Labs operating loss of \$3.3 B in Q4 and \$10.2 B for 2021**, sharpening investor focus on long-dated, cash-consuming bets while core growth slowed. ([Q4 Capital][8])
  Breadcrumbs: capex intensity; hardware R\&D; long-horizon ROI.

* **Expense and capex trajectory into 2022.** Meta set **2022 expense guidance at \$90–95 B** (later trimmed), and **2022 capex at \$29–34 B**, underscoring investment intensity into infra and AI while near-term revenue slowed—fuel for multiple compression. ([Meta Investor][9], [Q4 Capital][10])
  Breadcrumbs: opex growth; data centers; servers; margin pressure.

* **Macro & regulatory context (secondary accelerants).** Coverage highlighted **slowing global ad demand** and persistent concerns about **regulatory risk** (privacy, competition)—factors that compounded the post-guidance rerating. ([Reuters][11])
  Breadcrumbs: ad cycle; FX headwinds; regulatory overhang.

* **Market-cap wipeout optics.** The day-after effect was the **largest one-day value loss in U.S. market history**—about **\$230–\$251 B**—which further entrenched bearish sentiment. ([Bloomberg][12], [Reuters][13])
  Breadcrumbs: historic drawdown; sentiment shock; volatility clustering.

# Why these combined into a “perfect storm”

* **Model stress test.** ATT reduced **targeting & measurement precision → lower pricing & ROI for advertisers**, exactly when **user-time rotated to Reels** with **lower early monetization**, while **opex/capex** stayed high and **DAU ticked down**—so **revenue growth slowed** as **costs stayed elevated**, compressing **operating leverage** and **valuation multiples**. ([Q4 Capital][14], [TechCrunch][7], [Meta Investor][9])

* **Narrative shock.** Meta went from a high-margin ads compounder to a business **retooling its ad stack and feed economics** under competitive and platform-policy pressure, **while funding a multi-year metaverse bet**—a narrative step-change that markets immediately priced. ([Reuters][3], [Fortune][6], [Q4 Capital][8])

**Q: What effected their once profitable Ads business?**

**A:** Great follow-up — let’s unpack **what hit Meta’s advertising engine**, once the most profitable in tech, during the 2022–2023 downturn.

---

## 1. Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT)

* **Policy change (iOS 14.5+, April 2021):** Required users to *opt-in* for cross-app tracking. Opt-in rates stayed very low (<25%).
* **Impact:**

  * Meta lost visibility into user behavior outside its apps → **degraded targeting and attribution**.
  * Advertisers saw **lower ROI and measurement uncertainty**; many cut budgets or shifted to channels with clearer signals.
  * Meta itself estimated a **≈ \$10 billion revenue hit in 2022** from ATT.
* **Translation for ads business:** Lower *effective CPMs* (prices advertisers will pay) and increased reliance on probabilistic/aggregated models rather than deterministic targeting.

## 2. Competition from TikTok (and Reels cannibalization)

* **Shift in user time-spend:** Younger demographics spent more time on TikTok, eroding Meta’s dominance in attention.
* **Reels pivot:** Instagram/Facebook Reels gained traction, but in early 2022–2023:

  * **Monetized at a lower rate** than Feed or Stories ads.
  * **Cannibalized higher-ARPU formats** (advertisers followed user attention to Reels, but ad yield lagged).
* **Effect:** Engagement grew, but monetization efficiency fell, compressing ad margins.

## 3. Rising Costs + Shifts in Demand

* **Infrastructure & AI investment:** While ads slowed, Meta’s opex and capex kept rising (2022 expenses guided at \$90–95B; capex \$29–34B). That left less room to absorb ad revenue softness.
* **Macro backdrop:** Advertisers pulled back in late 2022 amid recession fears, inflation, and strong USD. FX headwinds further reduced reported ad revenue.

## 4. Privacy & Regulatory Overhang

* Beyond Apple:

  * **GDPR enforcement in Europe** restricted data sharing and required new consent mechanisms.
  * Anticipation of U.S./EU antitrust action created uncertainty for advertisers reliant on Meta’s scale.
* Result: More pressure on Meta to move away from granular behavioral targeting toward **broader contextual and AI-inferred targeting**.

## 5. Advertiser Sentiment and ROI

* Many small/medium advertisers (core of Meta’s ad base) reported:

  * **Lower conversion rates per dollar spent**.
  * Difficulty reconciling **conversion lift** due to measurement gaps.
* Meta responded by developing:

  * **Aggregated Event Measurement (AEM)** to work within ATT limits.
  * **AI-driven Advantage+ campaigns**, which by 2023–2024 reached a **\$10B annual run-rate**.

## Summary Table

| Factor                        | Mechanism of Damage                           | Scale of Impact                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Apple ATT**                 | Loss of tracking, attribution, and targeting  | ≈ \$10B annual                   |
| **TikTok & Reels**            | Shift in time-spend; lower monetization yield | Billions in cannibalized revenue |
| **Macro slowdown**            | Ad budget cuts, FX headwinds                  | Mid-single-digit % growth hit    |
| **Regulation & privacy laws** | Forced consent changes; dampened data quality | Multi-billion, hard to quantify  |
| **Advertiser ROI decline**    | Lower effectiveness, weaker reporting         | Significant SMB pullback         |

---

✅ **In short:** Meta’s once-dominant ads engine was squeezed by *signal loss (Apple), attention loss (TikTok), monetization lag (Reels), and macro/regulatory drag*. Zuckerberg’s pivot to **AI-driven targeting + efficiency** (Advantage+, Llama-powered ad tools) ultimately rebuilt the business by 2023–2025.

Do you want me to also chart **Meta’s ads revenue growth rate 2019–2025** so you can *see* how sharply the slowdown hit in 2022 and how it recovered post-pivot?

**Q: Is it grammatically correct to say "after the EU fine of them and Apple" or "after the EU fine of they and Apple"?**

**A:** The grammatically correct phrasing is:

**“after the EU fine of them and Apple.”**

Here’s why:

* The object of the preposition **“of”** must be in the **objective case** (me, him, her, us, them), not the subject case (I, he, she, we, they).
* Therefore, **“of them and Apple”** is correct.
* **“of they and Apple”** is ungrammatical because “they” is a subject pronoun, not an object pronoun.

---

### Alternatives for clarity and style

You might find these smoother in formal writing:

* **“after the EU fine imposed on Meta and Apple”** (direct, avoids pronoun)
* **“after the EU fined them and Apple”** (if you mean the EU acted against both parties)

---

Would you like me to also rephrase it in a **legal/financial reporting style** (like how Reuters or the FT would word it)? That might make it flow more naturally.

**Q: Can you recommend a rule-of-thumb as to when to apply the rule?**

**A:** Yes — there’s a very reliable **rule of thumb** you can use:

---

## Rule of Thumb

> **If the word functions as the subject of a clause, use the subject form (I, he, she, we, they).
> If it functions as the object of a verb or preposition, use the object form (me, him, her, us, them).**

---

## Quick Application Steps

1. **Find the governing word** (the verb or preposition).

   * Example: *of* (preposition), *fined* (verb).

2. **Ask what role the pronoun plays**:

   * If it’s **doing the action** → subject form.
   * If it’s **receiving the action** or **linked by a preposition** → object form.

3. **Check by removing the other noun(s)**:

   * *“after the EU fine of them.”* (sounds correct).
   * *“after the EU fine of they.”* (sounds wrong).
     This trick usually makes the choice obvious.

---

## Examples

* **Correct:**

  * *The award went to **him and her**.* (object of “to”)
  * *She and I are presenting tomorrow.* (subjects of the verb “are”)

* **Incorrect:**

  * *The award went to **he and she**.*
  * *Me and her are presenting tomorrow.*

---

So in your sentence:

* Preposition = *of*
* Objects = Meta (them) and Apple
  → Use **“of them and Apple.”**

---

Would you like me to also draft a **one-line memory aid** (like a pocket rule journalists and lawyers often keep) so you can recall it instantly when writing?
