- **Performance Impact:**
  - **Execution Speed:** Slight overhead due to function calls, but optimized by the engine.
  - **Memory Usage:** Minimal, as functions are reused.
  - **Best Use:** Reusable logic that requires input/output parameters.

### **Macros**
- **Description:** Similar to functions but operate at the node level, expanding into the calling graph.
- **Performance Impact:**
  - **Execution Speed:** Potentially faster since they are inlined, eliminating function call overhead.
  - **Memory Usage:** Can increase memory usage and node count if overused, as macros expand each time they are called.
  - **Best Use:** Repetitive node patterns that don’t require input/output parameters.

### **Event Dispatchers**
- **Description:** Allow Blueprints to communicate events to other Blueprints in a decoupled manner.
- **Performance Impact:**
  - **Execution Speed:** Minimal overhead for broadcasting events.
  - **Memory Usage:** Slight increase due to delegate storage.
  - **Best Use:** Decoupled communication between Blueprints, such as notifying multiple listeners about an event.

**_Best Practice:_** Use functions for reusable logic with parameters and return values. Use macros sparingly for repetitive node patterns that don’t require parameterization. Utilize event dispatchers for decoupled communication between Blueprints to maintain modularity.

## 3. **Pure vs. Impure Functions**

### **Pure Functions**
- **Description:** Functions that do not modify any state and return the same output given the same input.
- **Performance Impact:**
  - **Execution Speed:** Potentially optimized by the engine, as they can be cached or evaluated in parallel.
  - **Memory Usage:** Lower, as they don’t alter state.
  - **Best Use:** Calculations or data retrieval that doesn’t affect the game state.

### **Impure Functions**
- **Description:** Functions that can modify state or have side effects.
- **Performance Impact:**
  - **Execution Speed:** Slight overhead due to state changes and potential side effects.
  - **Memory Usage:** May require more memory for state management.
  - **Best Use:** Functions that need to alter game state, such as modifying variables or triggering events.

**_Best Practice:_** Use pure functions whenever possible to allow the engine to optimize their execution. Reserve impure functions for scenarios where state modification is necessary.

## 4. **Variable Access Patterns**

### **Local vs. Global Variables**
- **Local Variables:**
  - **Description:** Defined within functions or scopes, accessible only where they are declared.
  - **Performance Impact:** Faster access due to limited scope and easier optimization.
  
- **Global Variables:**
  - **Description:** Defined at the Blueprint class level, accessible from any part of the Blueprint or other Blueprints.
  - **Performance Impact:** Slower access compared to local variables due to broader scope and potential for increased memory usage.

### **Variable Access Techniques**
- **Direct Access vs. Getter/Setter Functions:**
  - **Direct Access:** Faster but less encapsulated.
  - **Getter/Setter Functions:** Slightly slower due to function calls but better for encapsulation and future-proofing.

**_Best Practice:_** Favor local variables within functions to minimize access overhead. Use getter and setter functions for global variables to maintain encapsulation and allow for potential optimizations.

## 5. **Looping Structures**

### **For Loops vs. For Each Loops vs. While Loops**

- **For Loops:**
  - **Description:** Iterates a set number of times based on a counter.
  - **Performance Impact:** Efficient for fixed-size iterations; predictable performance.

- **For Each Loops:**
  - **Description:** Iterates over elements in a collection.
  - **Performance Impact:** Slight overhead due to collection traversal but optimized for dynamic collections.

- **While Loops:**
  - **Description:** Continues to iterate as long as a condition is true.
  - **Performance Impact:** Can lead to unpredictable performance if not carefully managed, potentially causing infinite loops.

**_Best Practice:_** Use for loops for fixed-size iterations and for each loops for dynamic collections. Avoid while loops unless necessary, and ensure termination conditions are well-defined to prevent performance issues.

## 6. **Tick Usage**

### **Event Tick vs. Timers**

- **Event Tick:**
  - **Description:** Executes logic every frame.
  - **Performance Impact:** High overhead if overused or containing complex logic, especially on objects with multiple ticks.

- **Timers:**
  - **Description:** Executes logic at specified intervals.
  - **Performance Impact:** Lower overhead compared to ticks, as they execute less frequently.

**_Best Practice:_** Minimize the use of Event Tick. Use timers or event-driven approaches where possible to reduce per-frame overhead. If tick is necessary, ensure the logic is optimized and only active when required.
