**Q: If my corporate 401(k) is vested how do I roll it over into a private Roth account?**

**A:** Do a **direct trustee-to-trustee rollover** from your 401(k) to a Roth IRA, then plan for the tax bill on any **pre-tax** dollars converted in the year of the rollover. Avoid taking a check. Elect **no withholding** from the plan and pay estimated taxes from cash. ([IRS][1])

### Procedure

1. **Open the destination Roth IRA** (if you don’t already have one). Then **request a direct rollover to a Roth IRA** from your plan administrator. Provide the Roth IRA custodian’s payee and account details. This avoids the plan’s **mandatory 20% withholding** that applies if funds are paid to you first. ([IRS][1])

2. **Confirm you’re allowed to distribute.** If you’ve **separated from service**, you can distribute. If still employed, you need an **in-service distribution** provision in the plan (plan-document/Summary Plan Description governs). ([IRS][1])

3. **Choose “Roth IRA” as the destination.** A rollover from a pre-tax 401(k) to a Roth IRA is a **taxable Roth conversion** in that year; there’s **no annual dollar cap** on conversions. ([IRS][2], [GovInfo][3])

4. **Handle 401(k) money types correctly.**
   * **Pre-tax 401(k) dollars → Roth IRA**: taxable this year. ([IRS][2])
   * **Roth 401(k) (designated Roth) → Roth IRA**: **non-taxable** direct rollover; custodians code it **1099-R Box 7 = H**. ([IRS][4])
   * **After-tax (non-Roth) 401(k) contributions**: in a single distribution, you may **split** the after-tax basis to **Roth IRA** and send the pre-tax earnings to a **traditional IRA** per **Notice 2014-54** to minimize tax. ([H\&R Block Tax preparation company][5])

5. **Paper trail.** Expect **Form 1099-R** from the 401(k) and **Form 5498** from the Roth IRA custodian reporting the conversion. For **plan→Roth IRA** direct rollovers, **code G** (or **H** for Roth 401(k)→Roth IRA) appears on 1099-R. ([IRS][6])

6. **Taxes and penalties.**
   * The converted amount from **pre-tax** dollars is ordinary income this year. **Avoid 20% withholding** by doing a **direct** rollover; if you take receipt, the plan must withhold 20% and you have **60 days** to redeposit the gross amount or the shortfall is a distribution. ([IRS][1])
   * **No 10% early-distribution penalty** applies to the **conversion amount itself**, but any amount **not rolled over** (e.g., withheld taxes you don’t replace) may be penalized if you’re under 59½. ([wellsfargo.com][7], [IRS][8])

7. **Five-year clocks.**
   * **Conversions**: each conversion starts its own **5-year penalty clock** on converted principal if you’re <59½. ([Fidelity][9])
   * **Roth 401(k) → Roth IRA**: your **Roth IRA’s** 5-year clock is based on when you first funded **any** Roth IRA, not the Roth 401(k) start date. ([IRS][10])
   Sources: Fidelity 5-year rule explainer — [https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/retirement/roth-ira-5-year-rule](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/retirement/roth-ira-5-year-rule) ; 26 CFR §1.408A-10 Q\&A-4 — [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.408A-10](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.408A-10)

### Edge cases to review before you pull the trigger

* **Company stock (NUA)**: If your 401(k) holds employer shares with large appreciation, compare a taxable **NUA** distribution strategy versus Roth conversion. NUA can shift the embedded gain to **long-term capital gains** in a brokerage account. ([IRS][11])

* **RMDs and timing**: You can’t roll over an **RMD** and must take it first. Note: since **2024**, **Roth 401(k)** owners have **no pre-death RMDs**, aligning with Roth IRAs. ([IRS][12])
Source: IRS Newsroom RMD reminder (Roth plan RMDs removed for 2024+) — [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-urges-many-retirees-to-make-required-withdrawals-from-retirement-plans-by-year-end-deadline](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-urges-many-retirees-to-make-required-withdrawals-from-retirement-plans-by-year-end-deadline)

* **One-per-year rule**: The IRA **one-rollover-per-12-months** rule does **not** apply to **plan→IRA** direct rollovers. ([IRS][1])
Source: IRS — [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/rollovers-of-retirement-plan-and-ira-distributions](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/rollovers-of-retirement-plan-and-ira-distributions)

* **Form 8606 scope**: You file **Form 8606** to report **IRA→Roth IRA** conversions and track IRA basis. **Plan→Roth IRA** conversions are reported on your 1099-R/return but aren’t the typical 8606 case unless IRA basis is involved. ([IRS][13])
Source: IRS Instructions for Form 8606 — [https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8606](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8606)

* **Medicare/ACA cliffs**: Conversions increase **MAGI** and can trigger **IRMAA** surcharges for Medicare Part B/D (2-year look-back) or reduce **ACA** premium credits. Plan conversion size across years to manage brackets. ([Social Security][14], [HealthCare.gov][15])
Sources: SSA Medicare premiums (IRMAA) — [https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/medicare/medicare-premiums.html](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/medicare/medicare-premiums.html) ; HealthCare.gov MAGI — [https://www.healthcare.gov/income-and-household-information/income/](https://www.healthcare.gov/income-and-household-information/income/)

### Quick checklist

* Open Roth IRA and gather custodian transfer instructions. ([IRS][1])
* Instruct plan for **direct rollover to Roth IRA**; elect **no withholding**. ([IRS][1])
* If you have **after-tax** 401(k) dollars, use **Notice 2014-54 split** in one distribution. ([H\&R Block Tax preparation company][5])
* Reserve cash for the **income tax** on converted pre-tax dollars. ([IRS][2])
* Track **5-year clocks** for conversions and your Roth IRA. ([Fidelity][9])
* Watch **IRMAA/ACA** thresholds if relevant. ([Social Security][14], [HealthCare.gov][15])

If you want, I can outline a one-year vs multi-year conversion plan that respects your target tax brackets and IRMAA thresholds, using specific dollar amounts.

**Q: Following separation does my 401(k) remain intact in a corporate account or are they required to cut me a check if I don't designate a rollover account within a certain timeframe?**

**A:** Short answer: it usually stays put. Plans can only “force you out” after separation for **small balances** and only after required notice.

* **≥ \$7,000 vested balance:** The plan cannot force a distribution under federal law. You can generally leave the money in the former employer’s 401(k) if the plan document allows. ([employeefiduciary.com][1])  Source: Employee Fiduciary summary — [https://www.employeefiduciary.com/blog/secure-act-2.0-summary](https://www.employeefiduciary.com/blog/secure-act-2.0-summary)

* **\$1,000–\$7,000:** Your former employer **may** force a distribution, but the default is an **automatic rollover to a safe-harbor IRA** in your name (not a check to you), per DOL’s automatic-rollover rule; the **upper limit increased to \$7,000** for distributions after Dec 31, 2023 (SECURE 2.0 §304).

* **< \$1,000:** The plan can **cash you out by check** (taxable unless you complete a 60-day rollover), though some plans still default these to an IRA. ([Vanguard][5])  Source: Vanguard SECURE 2.0 guide — [https://institutional.vanguard.com/content/dam/inst/iig-transformation/secure20/240067.01\_REG\_SCRACT\_BRO\_Sec2.0-Auto-Cash-Out-Brochure\_v2.pdf](https://institutional.vanguard.com/content/dam/inst/iig-transformation/secure20/240067.01_REG_SCRACT_BRO_Sec2.0-Auto-Cash-Out-Brochure_v2.pdf)

**Timing/notice rules:** Before any eligible rollover distribution, the plan must give you the **§402(f) special tax notice** and a **minimum 30-day election window** (you can waive it and proceed sooner). Historically the upper bound is **90–180 days** depending on current regs/plan administration. ([Legal Information Institute][6], [IRS][7])  Sources: Treas. Reg. §1.402(f)-1 — [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.402%28f%29-1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.402%28f%29-1) ; IRS Notice 2018-74 — [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-18-74.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-18-74.pdf)

**If a check is cut to you:** The plan must withhold **20%** federal income tax from any eligible rollover distribution paid to you. A **direct rollover** to an IRA avoids withholding. ([IRS][8])  Sources: IRS “Rollovers of retirement plan and IRA distributions” — [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/rollovers-of-retirement-plan-and-ira-distributions](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/rollovers-of-retirement-plan-and-ira-distributions) ; IRS Pub. 575 — [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p575](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p575)

Bottom line: unless your vested balance is **under \$7,000** and the plan has a **force-out** provision, they are **not required** to send you a check; your account can remain in the plan per the plan’s rules. Read your **Summary Plan Description** for its specific thresholds and timing.
