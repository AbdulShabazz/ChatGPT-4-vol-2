**Q: Explain the disease known as popcorn lung.**

**A:** Popcorn lung is bronchiolitis obliterans. It is a rare, usually irreversible scarring of the smallest airways that causes fixed airflow obstruction. The best-documented cause is inhalation exposure to the butter-flavor chemicals diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione in workplaces that handle flavorings. ([CDC][1], [New England Journal of Medicine][2])

# What it is

* Pathology. Constrictive fibrosis around membranous bronchioles that narrows or obliterates the lumen. Alveoli are typically spared. This produces air-trapping. ([ATS Journals][3], [PMC][4])
* Physiology. Persistent obstructive defect on spirometry that is poorly reversible with bronchodilators. ([PMC][5])

# Causes and settings

* Occupational inhalation. Flavoring production, microwave-popcorn mixing and packaging, coffee roasting and grinding. Principal agents are diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione. ([CDC][1])
* Other causes. After lung or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant, severe inhalational irritants, and some post-infectious cases. The same pathologic endpoint is labeled “bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome” after transplant. ([ATS Journals][6])

# Key exposure limits and numbers

* NIOSH recommended exposure limits for an 8-hour TWA: diacetyl 5 ppb. 2,3-pentanedione 9.3 ppb. Short-term 15-minute limits: diacetyl 25 ppb. 2,3-pentanedione 31 ppb. ([OSHA][7], [CDC][8])
* Lung-function decline documented in exposed popcorn workers. 22% of a followed cohort had excessive FEV₁ loss ≥300 mL or ≥10% over serial tests. Some mixers had extreme declines, including 1.3 L over 9 months. ([CDC][9])

# Symptoms

* Progressive exertional dyspnea. Dry cough. Wheeze. Chest tightness. Symptoms do not reliably improve away from work once disease is established. ([CDC][10])

# Diagnosis

* History. Occupational flavoring exposure or other relevant inhalational exposure. ([CDC][1])
* Spirometry. Fixed airflow obstruction with reduced FEV₁ and FEV₁/FVC. Limited bronchodilator response. ([PMC][5])
* High-resolution CT. Mosaic attenuation and expiratory air-trapping. Bronchial-wall thickening. Findings support but do not alone confirm diagnosis. ([ERS Publications][11], [American Journal of Roentgenology][12])
* Lung biopsy. Constrictive peribronchiolar fibrosis may confirm when noninvasive data are inconclusive. Biopsy is not always pursued due to risk. ([ATS Journals][3])

# Management

* Immediate exposure control. Remove or minimize exposure with engineering controls, substitution, local exhaust, and respiratory protection. ([CDC][8])
* Medical therapy. Symptom-directed bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids are often tried. Evidence for macrolides such as azithromycin is strongest in post-transplant BOS and is applied case-by-case in non-transplant disease. Systemic steroids are not reliably effective and carry risk. Advanced disease may require lung transplantation. ([PMC][13], [ASH Publications][14])
* Prognosis. Scarring is usually permanent. Stabilization is possible if exposure stops early and lung function is preserved. ([CDC][10])

# “Vaping and popcorn lung” in brief

* Many flavored e-liquids tested in 2015–2016 contained diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione. One analysis detected diacetyl in 39 of 51 products with concentrations up to 239 µg per device. ([PubMed][15])
* Regulators in some countries later restricted diacetyl in vaping products. Health agencies note concern but report no confirmed national case series of vaping-caused bronchiolitis obliterans to date, while isolated case reports of constrictive bronchiolitis in people who vape have appeared. Conclusion today: risk is biologically plausible where diacetyl is present, but confirmed incidence remains very low and uncertain. ([nhs.uk][16], [Canada.ca][17], [ScienceDirect][18])

# Prevention for at-risk workplaces

* Monitor airborne alpha-diketones against the NIOSH RELs.
* Enclose mixing. Use local exhaust ventilation. Substitute safer formulations where feasible. Provide fit-tested respirators when controls cannot achieve RELs. Provide medical surveillance with periodic spirometry. ([CDC][8])
