### Key Differences:
- **Price:** The Hifiman Susvara is significantly more expensive at approximately $6,000 compared to the Camerton Binom ER's $3,700.
- **Driver Type:** The Binom ER utilizes a single-cone dynamic driver, while the Susvara uses planar magnetic technology.
- **Sensitivity & Power Requirements:** The Camerton Binom ER is much more sensitive at 105 dB, making it easier to drive with a variety of amplifiers. In contrast, the Susvara has a low sensitivity of 83 dB, requiring a high-power amplifier.
- **Frequency Response:** The Susvara offers a much wider frequency range, particularly in the upper frequencies, extending up to 75 kHz compared to the Binom ER's 25 kHz.
- **Weight:** The Binom ER is lighter at 380 grams compared to the Susvara’s 450 grams, potentially making it more comfortable for long listening sessions.

Each model caters to a different listening philosophy, with the Binom ER focusing on an immersive and natural sound, while the Susvara excels in analytical detail and a vast soundstage, but requires high-end amplification to unlock its full potential.
