## OpenAI ChatGPT v1.2025.330 Game.Size.Trends.And.Compression.md

**Q: Are video games expected to get larger in size such that Unreal Engine should invest in better shipper packing tools for improved download bandwidth management and better compression?**

**A:** Short answer: Yes, the natural trend still pushes AAA games larger, and there is clear evidence that better packing/compression and patching tooling can cut that growth dramatically. Unreal should absolutely treat “shipper packing tools” as a first-class investment area.

1. Are game sizes still growing?

* Over roughly the last decade, the average PC game size rose from ~11 GB (2012) to ~80 GB (2023). ([TechSpot][1])
* Modern AAA titles commonly sit in the 50–200 GB range. ([Airband][2])
* By 2023, multiple high-profile PC releases in a single year were in the 90–130 GB range, normalizing “100 GB games”. ([PC Gamer][3])

Drivers are mostly content, not code:

* 4K/8K textures, high-poly meshes, baked lightmaps, multi-language VO and music.
* Live-service content updates that accumulate assets and legacy data over time. ([Reddit][4])

So absent countermeasures, yes: big, high-fidelity Unreal titles will tend to grow.

2. Counter-trend: smarter packing can shrink games a lot

The Helldivers 2 example is the perfect data point:

* Install size was cut from ~154 GB to ~23 GB (≈85% reduction) primarily by de-duplicating assets that had been intentionally duplicated for old HDD-layout optimizations. ([Tom's Hardware][5])
* Functionality and load times barely changed.

This demonstrates that:

* A large fraction of game bloat is avoidable.
* Good tooling plus analysis can yield 50–80% reductions without changing gameplay.

That strongly motivates engine-level investment: most teams will not build this kind of content tooling on their own.

3. What Unreal Engine already has in this space

Unreal is not starting from zero:

* Oodle Data for .pak / IoStore compression, integrated as a plugin to shrink shipped content. ([Epic Games Developers][6])
* Oodle Texture + platform-level decompression (e.g., PS5 hardware supports Oodle Kraken/Zlib) to balance I/O and CPU/GPU cost. ([NeoGAF][7])
* Newer RAD Audio codec in UE 5.4 for better audio compression than legacy Bink audio. ([Epic Games Developers][8])
* HTTP Chunk Install / chunked builds for staged downloads and partial installs. ([Epic Games Developers][9])

However, these are mostly low-level building blocks; they still require careful manual setup and discipline by each studio.

4. Why it still makes sense for Unreal to invest more

Given the trends:

* Install sizes trend upward with asset resolution and content breadth.
* Not all players have fast, uncapped broadband or giant SSDs; compression and smart shipping are still a UX and reach constraint. ([Reddit][10])

And the opportunity:

* Real-world examples show 20–80% reductions are possible without gameplay changes if the pipeline is optimized. ([Reddit][11])

It is rational for Unreal to push further in:

1. Higher-level packaging workflows

   * Editor-side tools that show “where your gigabytes are” by content type (texture/audio/mesh/lightmap).
   * Wizards or presets for “Base + optional 4K textures + optional VO languages” with automatic chunking and manifests.

2. Better diff/patch support

   * Engine-provided delta patch format so updates ship “changed data only” rather than full replacement .pak files.
   * Integration with IoStore/Oodle so chunks are sized and grouped to maximize re-use across versions.

3. Automatic deduplication and cleanup

   * Content-addressed storage or dedup of identical assets across DLCs / regions / platforms.
   * Tools to detect unused assets, obsolete patches, and duplication patterns created by HDD-era layout tricks.

4. Bandwidth-aware install profiles

   * Built-in support for selectable install “tiers” (e.g., “Performance/1080p pack” vs “Cinematic/4K pack”) and for pre-fetching only what a player’s platform can actually display.
   * Optional compression tiers tuned per platform (console SSD vs low-end PC HDD).

5. Telemetry-driven defaults

   * Epic has global visibility across many shipped UE titles; aggregated data about which compression/packing setups work best could be distilled into sane, opinionated defaults and templates.

---

5. Net conclusion

* Yes, high-end games are structurally pushed toward larger sizes, but recent examples show that with proper tooling, those sizes can be held flat or even reduced.
* Because Unreal is already the primary “shipper” for many studios (through its build, packaging, and chunking pipeline), incremental investment in better packing/compression and bandwidth-aware workflows has outsized leverage.
* From an engine-strategy standpoint, it is justified for Unreal to treat advanced shipper/packing tools as a core competitive feature, not a peripheral concern.
