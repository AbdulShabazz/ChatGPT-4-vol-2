**Q: How fast in milliseconds are the drum kick notes in the metal band angelMaker's song Altare Mortis?**

**A:** The kick spacing in “Altare Mortis” is on the order of ~115 ms for the typical fast double-kick runs.

Reasoning:

1. Tempo
   Streaming analysis sites give “Altare Mortis” a tempo of 131 BPM in 4/4. ([Songdata][1])

2. Convert BPM → milliseconds per beat

   * One minute = 60,000 ms
   * Quarter-note (1 beat) at 131 BPM:
     [
     \text{quarter} = \frac{60000\ \text{ms}}{131} \approx 458.0\ \text{ms}
     ]
   * Eighth-note (2 per beat):
     [
     \text{eighth} = \frac{458.0}{2} \approx 229.0\ \text{ms}
     ]
   * Sixteenth-note (4 per beat):
     [
     \text{sixteenth} = \frac{458.0}{4} \approx 114.5\ \text{ms}
     ]
   * Thirty-second-note (8 per beat):
     [
     \text{thirty-second} = \frac{458.0}{8} \approx 57.3\ \text{ms}
     ]

3. Interpreting the drums

   * If the drummer is playing steady 16th-note double-kicks at the song’s main pulse, consecutive kick hits are ≈114–115 ms apart.
   * If any passages are notated in “double-time” (effectively 262 BPM), the math is identical for the actual time spacing: the fastest constant-kick grids you’d hear correspond to ≈57 ms between hits (32nds at 131 BPM / 16ths at 262 BPM).

So, in practical terms for that track:

* Quarter-note pulse: ~458 ms
* 8th-note kicks: ~229 ms
* 16th-note double-kicks (what you typically perceive as “fast kicks”): ~115 ms between hits
* Extreme fastest grid (32nds): ~57 ms between hits
