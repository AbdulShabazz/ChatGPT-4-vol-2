**Q: Cite five papers published on the topic of path tracing this quarter you find influential and explain your reasons.**

**A:** 1. Zeng et al., “ReSTIR PG: Path Guiding with Spatiotemporally Resampled Paths” (ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 Conference Papers, December 2025). ([Computer Science][1])
   Reason: Integrates Reservoir-based SpatioTemporal Importance Resampling (ReSTIR) with explicit path guiding, i.e., it converts reused spatiotemporal path samples into a guiding signal rather than treating resampling as only a variance-reduction end in itself. This is a pragmatic step toward “learning the next frame’s sampling distribution from last frame’s successful paths” in real-time/interactive path tracing.

2. Hong et al., “Sample Space Partitioning and Spatiotemporal Resampling for Specular Manifold Sampling” (ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 Conference Papers, December 2025). ([graphics.cs.utah.edu][2])
   Reason: Tackles the persistent hard case for path tracing—high-energy specular paths/caustics—by pairing specular manifold sampling with spatiotemporal reuse. The “sample-space partitioning” framing is influential because it treats caustic discovery as a structured search problem over path space, then amortizes that discovery across pixels/frames.

3. Treder et al., “A compact stochastic representation for Monte Carlo Path Traced images” (ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 Conference Papers, December 2025). ([ACM Digital Library][3])
   Reason: Directly targets the data model of Monte Carlo path traced output (stochasticity as signal, not just noise), which is increasingly important as renderers mix classic estimators with neural/temporal reconstruction. Compact representations that preserve uncertainty structure are a leverage point for denoising, adaptive sampling, and temporal stability pipelines.

4. Ahmed et al., “SZ Sequences: Binary-Constructed (0, 2^q)-Sequences” (ACM Transactions on Graphics, online publication December 4, 2025). ([ACM Digital Library][4])
   Reason: Low-discrepancy sampling is still one of the highest return-on-effort improvements in production path tracing. This paper is influential because it proposes a practical, drop-in sequence family (binary generator matrices) with measurable error reductions in common rendering integrals, and with implementation properties (bitwise ops, Sobol-like integration) that matter in real engines.

5. Sakai et al., “Statistical Error Reduction for Monte Carlo Rendering” (ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 Conference Papers, December 2025). ([TU Wien Computer Graphics][5])
   Reason: Treats variance reduction/denoising as a statistical estimation problem over sample distributions (not just heuristic filtering). That perspective is influential for path tracing because it can unify denoising choices with stopping criteria, adaptive sampling allocation, and confidence estimation—critical when pushing to very low samples per pixel (SPP) regimes.

If you want only “path construction / sampling” (excluding denoising/reconstruction), say “sampling-only” and I’ll swap (3) and (5) for two additional Q4 2025 sampling papers from the same SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 proceedings.
