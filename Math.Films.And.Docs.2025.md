**Q: Are there any movies or documentaries that present math in a Veritasium sort of way, depicting how breakthrough thinking leads to new mathematics?**

**A:** Yes. These are the closest “Veritasium-style” watches where the core is *how breakthroughs happen* (problem framing → new ideas → proof or new structures), not just “math is cool.”

* **NOVA: The Proof (1997)** — Andrew Wiles’ Fermat’s Last Theorem campaign; shows the long private-search phase, strategy pivots, and what “proof” means culturally/technically inside mathematics. ([PBS][1])
* **Counting from Infinity: Yitang Zhang and the Twin Prime Conjecture** — modern research in action: an outsider result triggers a global sprint, technique refinement, and community validation dynamics. ([PBS][2])
* **Secrets of the Surface: The Mathematical Vision of Maryam Mirzakhani** — depicts how a mathematician “sees” problems (geometric intuition, exploration, iteration) and turns that into new results. ([ZALA Films][3])
* **NOVA: Hunting the Hidden Dimension (2008)** — fractals/geometry presented as a discovery story with “maverick” idea formation and the push from visual intuition to formal tools. ([PBS][4])
* **NOVA: The Great Math Mystery (2015)** — higher-level, but it does show multiple examples of invention/discovery, why certain abstractions “stick,” and how math becomes usable across domains. ([IMDb][5])
* **The Story of Maths (BBC, 2008)** — historical breakthroughs (zero, calculus, etc.) framed as problem-driven invention; less “lab notebook,” more narrative of conceptual leaps. ([Wikipedia][6])
* **A Trip to Infinity (Netflix, 2022)** — concept-driven (infinity) with classic thought experiments; more philosophical/visual than proof-centric, but can scratch the “ideas evolving” itch. ([The New Yorker][7])

If you want the tightest match to “breakthrough thinking → new mathematics,” prioritize: **The Proof**, **Counting from Infinity**, **Secrets of the Surface**.

**Q: YES! This list is fantastic!!**

**A:** Acknowledged. If you want, I can extend this with a **next-tier list** focused on *active conjectures, failed proof paths, and modern technique shifts* (e.g., polymath projects, computer-assisted proofs, or intuition-first geometry work), or narrow it to a specific domain such as number theory, topology, or foundations.

**Q: Proceed!**

**A:** Next-tier “breakthrough thinking → new mathematics” watches (plus a few high-production short films in the same spirit).

Collaborative sprints and living conjectures

* **Counting from Infinity: Yitang Zhang and the Twin Prime Conjecture** (2015, feature documentary). The closest thing to “research culture on camera”: solitary insight → rapid community verification → coordinated improvement. ([ZALA Films][1])
* **Polymath (massively collaborative online mathematics) context**: use this as the “how modern breakthroughs get industrialized” companion to *Counting from Infinity*. Background on what Polymath is and why it matters. ([The polymath blog][2])
* **Prime gaps follow-ups (Quanta Magazine)**: not a single long documentary, but excellent narrative journalism on the same breakthrough arc (Zhang → Maynard → Polymath) if you want more “what changed technically and why.” ([Quanta Magazine][3])

Computer-assisted proofs and “what counts as proof now”

* **The Flyspeck Project / formal proof of the Kepler conjecture** (talks/lectures; high-level but concrete). This is the canonical case study for computer-verified mathematics at scale (HOL Light + Isabelle proof assistants). ([Microsoft][4])
* **A computer-checked proof of the Four Colour Theorem (Coq proof assistant)** (talks + writeups). Useful if you want the “from controversial computer-checking to formally verified proof” transition. ([Chalmers CSE][5])
* **Four-colour theorem story video (Quanta Magazine via Aeon)**: tight “problem → decades of failed approaches → computer involvement → conceptual aftermath” presentation. ([Aeon][6])

“New ideas under constraint” (algorithms / complexity as the frontier)

* **P vs NP: The Greatest Unsolved Problem in Computer Science (Quanta video)**: concise, high-production framing of the conjecture and why progress is hard (complexity-theory breakthrough dynamics). ([Quanta Magazine][7])
* **The Secret Rules of Modern Living: Algorithms** (British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Four, 2015): invention-driven algorithmic thinking, with “why this abstraction works” emphasis. ([Educational Recording Agency][8])
* **The Code** (BBC Two, 2011; Marcus du Sautoy): less “new math,” more “how mathematical structure is discovered and reused across domains.” ([Wikipedia][9])

Near-2025, explicitly math-centered (more narrative, but “breakthrough” themed)

* **Prime Target** (Apple TV+, premiered January 22, 2025): thriller built around a prime-number “breakthrough” premise (more fiction than math, but it leans into discovery stakes). ([Apple TV][10])
* **Counted Out** (2025 documentary): not “new theorem discovery,” but very strong on “math/algorithms reshape power; who gets counted and how,” if you want modern stakes tied to quantitative thinking. ([COUNTED OUT][11])

If you want, pick one target domain (number theory, geometry/topology, or complexity) and I will produce a tight, ordered watch path (3–6 items) optimized for “conceptual leap density” rather than general popularity.
