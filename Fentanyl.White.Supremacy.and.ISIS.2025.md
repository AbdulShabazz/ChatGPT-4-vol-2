## FBI Fentanyl White Supremacy Links

**Q:** Has the FBI established a link between Fentanyl, ISIS, and white supremacy groups in the United States?

**A:** As of January 2025, the FBI has not established any direct links between fentanyl trafficking, ISIS, and white supremacist groups operating within the United States. However, the agency has identified connections between fentanyl distribution and certain white supremacist organizations.

**Fentanyl and White Supremacist Groups:**

- **SFV Peckerwoods:** In October 2024, federal authorities arrested 42 members and associates of the San Fernando Valley Peckerwoods, a white supremacist street gang based in California. The 76-count federal grand jury indictment alleged that the gang engaged in a years-long pattern of racketeering activity, including trafficking of drugs—specifically fentanyl—illegal firearms possession, and COVID-19 benefits and loan fraud. 

- **Aryan Family:** In March 2023, 27 individuals were indicted for drug trafficking, many of whom were tied to the "Aryan Family," a white supremacist prison gang. The investigation led to the seizure of more than 1.9 million doses of fentanyl and over 225 firearms and firearm parts. 

**Fentanyl and ISIS:**

There is no publicly available evidence indicating a direct connection between ISIS and fentanyl trafficking within the United States. ISIS has primarily funded its operations through means such as oil smuggling, taxation, and extortion in territories it controls or influences.

**Conclusion:**

While the FBI has uncovered links between fentanyl trafficking and certain white supremacist groups in the U.S., there is no established connection involving ISIS in this context. The agency continues to monitor and investigate these organizations to address the threats they pose to public safety.
