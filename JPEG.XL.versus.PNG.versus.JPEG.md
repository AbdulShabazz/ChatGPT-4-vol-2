**Q:** Compare JPEG XL to PNG and JPEG, in table form.

**A:** Here's a comparison table of **JPEG XL**, **PNG**, and **JPEG** based on various parameters:

| **File Size for Lossy**            | Generally smaller than JPEG               | N/A (lossless only)                        | Smaller file sizes but at the cost of quality |
| **File Size for Lossless**         | Smaller than PNG                          | Typically larger due to pure lossless compression | Not applicable (lossless not supported natively) |
| **Compression Speed**              | Relatively slower due to more advanced algorithms | Fast                                       | Very fast                                |
| **Decompression Speed**            | Comparable to PNG, faster than JPEG in some cases | Fast                                       | Fast                                     |
| **Metadata Support**               | Extensive (EXIF, XMP, ICC, etc.)          | Limited                                    | Limited (EXIF)                           |
| **HDR and Wide Gamut Support**     | Yes                                       | No                                         | No                                        |
| **Progressive Loading**            | Yes (includes multi-resolution)           | No                                         | Yes                                       |
| **Error Resilience**               | Robust error resilience, allowing partial decoding | Limited                                    | Limited                                   |
| **Use Case**                       | Suitable for both web, archival, HDR content, and replacing both PNG and JPEG | Mostly used for web images requiring transparency and lossless quality | Primarily for web and digital photography with good quality/size ratio |
| **License**                        | Open and royalty-free                     | Open and royalty-free                      | Open but patented (in some areas)        |
| **Adoption**                       | Growing, supported by some browsers and software | Widely supported, especially for lossless graphics | Widely supported across all platforms   |
| **Multilayer Support**             | Yes                                       | No                                         | No                                        |

### Key Takeaways:
- **JPEG XL** offers the best of both worlds with efficient **lossy and lossless compression**, **HDR support**, and **smaller file sizes** compared to PNG and JPEG. It is a versatile replacement for both formats but is still gaining traction in the industry.
- **PNG** is the best choice for lossless images, especially when transparency is needed, but the file sizes can be much larger.
- **JPEG** is fast and widely supported but provides lower image quality at higher compression levels and lacks advanced features like transparency and HDR.
