## OpenAI ChatGPT v1.2025.224 

**Q: To reform social security pay-as-you-go pyramid nonsense, all that is required is for the government to take out a 30 year loan (since this is the smallest age group beyond age 65 that may still be available to collect benefits!), to subsidize future retirees for the next 30 years; and everyone aged 35 and younger simply receives the benefits they've paid into the program.**

**A:** You’ve outlined a provocative reform idea that essentially seeks to **close the pay-as-you-go loop** by using government borrowing to buy time, while transitioning Social Security into a system where younger contributors only ever receive what they themselves paid in. Let me break down the mechanics, feasibility, and implications:

---

## 1. Your Proposal in Structured Terms

* **Initial Financing via Loan:**

  * Government issues a **30-year bond/loan** to cover all benefit obligations for current retirees (65+) and near-retirees who will be eligible over the next 30 years.
  * The size of this loan would be enormous because Social Security currently pays out roughly **\$1.4 trillion annually** (2023 OASDI benefits). Over 30 years, that’s **\~\$42 trillion**, not including inflation or benefit growth.

* **New Benefit Rules:**

  * **Ages 35 and under:** Only receive benefits equal to what they contributed (a defined-contribution style system, not defined-benefit).
  * **Ages 36–64:** Still receive benefits, financed by the 30-year loan.
  * **Ages 65+:** Continue to receive current law benefits, financed by the loan.

* **End Goal:** By 30 years out, the "pay-as-you-go" structure has ended. Benefits past that date are either self-funded (through personal contributions) or phased out entirely.

---

## 2. Fiscal Implications

* **Loan Size & Debt Service:**

  * If the government borrows **\$42T** at, say, 4% average interest, annual interest is **\$1.68T**, larger than the entire Defense budget.
  * U.S. federal debt is already \~**\$34T** (2025). Adding \$42T more would more than double it.
  * Servicing costs would rival or exceed Social Security’s current funding problem.

* **Taxpayer Distribution:**

  * Future taxpayers still shoulder repayment of this loan (unless default or inflation erodes it).
  * This shifts the pyramid from a **pay-as-you-go transfer system** to a **debt-financed transfer system**.

---

## 3. Demographic and Generational Effects

* **Older Generations (36+):**

  * Protected, receive promised benefits.
  * Enjoy a large government subsidy from the debt.

* **Younger Generations (≤35):**

  * No longer paying for older generations’ benefits.
  * Receive only what they put in—likely less than today’s promise, but actuarially fairer.
  * In theory, this group avoids the pyramid problem going forward.

* **Intergenerational Equity:**

  * This is essentially a **“grandfather clause” bailout** for older Americans, but younger Americans inherit the debt.

---

## 4. Economic and Political Obstacles

* **Debt Load & Markets:**

  * Markets might resist absorbing such a huge issuance of long-term bonds.
  * Interest rates could spike further, worsening the financing problem.
* **Inflationary Risk:**

  * Monetizing this debt (via Federal Reserve bond purchases) would be highly inflationary.
* **Political Impossibility:**

  * Social Security has **67 million beneficiaries** today, highly politically active.
  * Any reform that phases out benefits for under-35 workers would be politically toxic.

---

## 5. Alternative Transition Models (More Commonly Debated)

* **Partial Privatization:** Allow younger workers to invest part of payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts (Chile model, later reformed).
* **Means-Testing Benefits:** Reduce/eliminate benefits for wealthy retirees.
* **Gradual Age Adjustments:** Slowly increase retirement age beyond 67 to reflect life expectancy.
* **Payroll Tax Adjustments:** Lift the cap on taxable income (\$168,600 in 2024) or modestly raise the payroll tax rate.

---

## 6. Conceptual Summary

Your proposal is essentially a **“debt-funded phase-out”** of Social Security:

* It buys 30 years of solvency.
* It honors promises to those near/at retirement.
* It transitions younger workers into a “what you put in, you get back” system.
* The main downside: an immediate and massive surge in U.S. federal debt, risking interest costs, inflation, and fiscal instability.

---

Would you like me to **quantify the actual 30-year loan size** more precisely (including growth in beneficiaries, COLAs, and demographic projections from SSA), so you can see whether the debt level is technically serviceable or guaranteed to collapse under compounding interest?

**Q: The maturity date for the loan could be like the debt ceiling -- congress can simply agree to extend the terms of the loan. The loan amount and number of citizens subsidized is fixed, so, once paid off, social security is solvent. The government can always add an inflation match as a gesture to those younger whom pay into the program. I really don't see how adding another $42T in debt to guarantee solvency is any worse than the program as it is now.**

**A:** I get the appeal: borrow once, honor promises to today’s retirees, and let everyone ≤35 get only what they themselves put in—thereby ending the inter-generational “pay-as-you-go” loop. The catch is that Treasury debt doesn’t work like a “debt-ceiling extension,” and the scale/interest dynamics mean your proposal likely costs **more** than fixing Social Security directly.

Below is a concise, numbers-first read, with mechanisms and constraints called out.

---

# 1) Scale check (what you’re trying to finance)

* **Benefit flow today:** SSA reports \~**69 million** monthly beneficiaries in 2025 and \~**\$1.6T** in benefits for calendar-year 2025. ([Social Security][1])
  Source: ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf

* **Recent cost history:** 2024 OASDI **cost = \$1.485T**, income = \$1.418T; reserves fell from **\$2.788T → \$2.721T**. ([Social Security][2])
  Source: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf (Overview highlights)

* **Trust-fund depletion timing & cut if unaddressed:** Combined OASDI reserves projected **depleted in 2034**, after which only **\~81%** of scheduled benefits are payable under current law. ([Social Security][2])
  Source: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf (Overview figures)

* **Measured long-run gap (present value):** The Trustees’ **75-year open-group unfunded obligation = \$25.1T (PV)**; infinite-horizon PV **\$72.8T**. Actuarial deficit **= 3.82% of taxable payroll**. ([Social Security][2])
  Source: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf (IV.B, VI.F)

> Implication: your “\~\$42T over 30 years” ballpark (nominal) is larger than the Trustees’ **present-value** 75-year shortfall—but it would also **add interest** on top, which the Trustees’ actuarial measures do not assume is solved via new debt. ([Social Security][2])
> Source: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf (solutions equivalence)

# 2) “Just extend the maturity like the debt ceiling” ≠ how Treasury debt works

* **You cannot legislatively “extend” the maturity date of outstanding Treasuries.** They are contracts with fixed maturities. Treasury (and the Fed for its holdings) **rolls over** maturing principal by **issuing new securities** at then-current market rates. That is refinancing, not term-extension. ([Federal Reserve Bank of New York][3], [TreasuryDirect][4])
  Sources: newyorkfed.org/markets/treasury-rollover-faq ; treasurydirect.gov/help-center/treasury-bills/redeem-reinvest-treasury-bills/

* **Rollover risk:** large stocks of short/medium maturities must be refinanced continually, exposing you to rate spikes. (Background on rollover shares and costs.) ([markets.businessinsider.com][5], [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis][6])
  Sources: markets.businessinsider.com/.../us-debt-maturing... ; stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2023/jun/assessing-costs-rolling-over-government-debt

---

# 3) What a \$42T debt-finance does to the rest of the budget

* **Debt levels now:** Total public debt outstanding is about the **high-\$36T / low-\$37T** range in mid-2025 (gross; measures differ by source and timing). ([FRED][7], [Fiscal Data][8])
  Sources: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEBTN ; fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/

* **Interest trajectory:** CBO projects **net interest** rising from about **3.2% of GDP in 2025** to **\~5.4% of GDP by 2055** under current law, even **without** layering a new multi-decade Social Security transition bond on top. ([Congressional Budget Office][9], [Committee for Responsible Budget][10])
  Sources: cbo.gov/publication/61270 ; crfb.org/blogs/cbo-releases-march-2025-long-term-budget-and-economic-outlook

* **Illustrative carrying cost:** If the government borrowed **\$42T** and the **average rate** settled around **\~4%** over time (illustrative), **annual interest ≈ \$1.68T**—about the size of today’s entire Social Security benefit flow. That interest expands or shrinks with rates; refinancing keeps repricing it. (Rate context: see CBO and St. Louis Fed discussions above.) ([Congressional Budget Office][9], [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis][6])
  Sources: cbo.gov/publication/61270 ; stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2023/jun/assessing-costs-rolling-over-government-debt

> **Bottom line:** Converting a PAYGO gap into Treasury debt doesn’t erase the gap; it **moves it** into the **general fund as interest**—where it compounds and competes with defense, health, R\&D, etc. That is a riskier financing channel than a calibrated payroll-tax or benefit-formula fix measured by the Trustees. ([Social Security][2])
> Source: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf (tax/benefit equivalents)

---

# 4) “Fixed number of citizens subsidized” isn’t a fixed cost stream

* **Policy and demography move the goalposts:** 2025 Trustees incorporate **new law** (Social Security Fairness Act of 2023 repealing WEP/GPO) which **raises benefits** vs. prior reports; future policy and demographic shifts can change costs again. ([Social Security][2])
  Source: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf (Highlights)

* **Longevity tail:** At 65, expected remaining life is \~19–21 years (period table), but a **non-trivial share** survives to 95; a 30-year bond window doesn’t exactly match **lifetime** benefit tails for the 36–64 cohort you propose to subsidize. You’d either need a **sinking fund** that extends beyond 30 years or accept **rollover risk** after year 30. ([Social Security][11])
  Source: ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html

---

# 5) Solvency after payoff requires strict architecture for the ≤35 group

If everyone **≤35** “receives only what they paid in,” the design must:

* **Segregate contributions** in individual or notional accounts (to avoid using those contributions to pay the old system’s debt service, which would quietly restore PAYGO). ([World Bank][12], [World Bank][13])
  Sources: documents.worldbank.org/.../averting-the-old-age-crisis...

* **Define indexation** (wage vs. price) and minimum guarantees; risk-adjust returns per CBO methods if financial markets are used. ([Congressional Budget Office][14])
  Source: cbo.gov/publication/60815

* **Acknowledge transition costs:** Global experience shows **transition financing** from PAYGO to funded pillars is the hard part; many countries that jumped abruptly had to partially reverse course. ([CIS IER HIT University][15])
  Source: cis.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/Common/pdf/dp/2017/dp665.pdf

---

# 6) Is \$42T of new debt “no worse” than the status quo?

A direct apples-to-apples benchmark exists in the Trustees’ “fix-it-now” equivalences:

* **Immediate & permanent payroll-tax fix:** raise the combined OASDI rate from **12.40% → 16.05% (+3.65 percentage points)**; or
* **Immediate & permanent across-the-board benefit cut:** **−22.4%**; or
* **Mix** thereof. ([Social Security][2])
  Source: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf (Overview, Summary Measures)

Those options **close the actuarial gap** without imposing a new, compounding federal interest bill. In contrast, adding **\$42T** to gross debt means **permanent net-interest outlays** that CBO already shows growing to **\~5.4% of GDP** by 2055 **before** such borrowing—crowding out other priorities. ([Congressional Budget Office][9])
Source: cbo.gov/publication/61270

> In short: debt-financing the transition is **fiscally riskier** than parametric fixes because it swaps a measured payroll-shortfall for an **open-ended interest obligation** subject to market rates and continual rollover.

---

# 7) Legal/political practicality

* **Congress can change formulas (and has):** Social Security benefits are statutory, not contractual; *Flemming v. Nestor* affirms no property right to an unchanged benefit schedule. (This cuts both ways—law can add your “inflation match,” or pare it back.) ([Justia Law][16], [Oyez][17])
  Sources: supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/363/603/ ; oyez.org/cases/1959/54

* **Debt management principles:** Treasury adheres to regular, predictable issuance and transparency; it uses **refinancing/rollover and buybacks**, not unilateral term extensions. ([Congress.gov][18], [TreasuryDirect][19])
  Sources: congress.gov/crs-product/R40767 ; treasurydirect.gov/help-center/faqs/buyback-faqs/

---

## A pragmatic way to capture your goal (without exploding interest risk)

If you want to protect current/near retirees while ending PAYGO for younger workers, the **least-risk** version in U.S. practice tends to look like:

* **Define the funded pillar for ≤35** (individual or notional accounts), with **price-indexed** minimums to reduce long-term fiscal drift. (Design choice; price vs. wage indexing has large cost differences.) ([Every CRS Report][20])
  Source: everycrsreport.com/reports/R48224.html

* **Finance the “transition cohort”** with a **time-limited mix**: small payroll-surtax + gradual retirement-age indexing + high-earner tax-base broadening (e.g., raising or eliminating the taxable maximum) rather than a single mega-bond. These are textbook options acknowledged by SSA/GAO/CBO. ([Social Security][2], [Government Accountability Office][21], [Congressional Budget Office][9])
  Sources: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf ; gao.gov/products/gao-24-107240 ; cbo.gov/publication/61187

* **Keep any borrowing limited and scheduled** in a declining profile (a “transition amortization schedule”), so interest doesn’t become the new structural driver of deficits—which, per CBO, it already is trending to be. ([Congressional Budget Office][9])
  Source: cbo.gov/publication/61270

## Direct answers to your key assertions

* **“Congress can just extend the loan’s maturity like the debt ceiling.”**
  Not for outstanding bonds. Maturities are fixed; Treasury must **refinance** at market with new issuance. That preserves principal due dates and exposes you to **rate risk** each time. ([Federal Reserve Bank of New York][3], [TreasuryDirect][4])
  Sources: newyorkfed.org/markets/treasury-rollover-faq ; treasurydirect.gov/help-center/treasury-bills/redeem-reinvest-treasury-bills/

* **“The number subsidized is fixed; once paid off, Social Security is solvent.”**
  Costs to subsidize 36–64 aren’t “fixed” ex ante: COLAs, lifespan tails, disability incidence, and **law changes** (e.g., 2025 repeal of WEP/GPO) alter outlays; a 30-year window mismatches **lifetime** benefits unless you also build a tail fund or accept more refinancing. ([Social Security][2])
  Sources: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf ; ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html

* **“Adding \~\$42T in debt is no worse than today’s system.”**
  Today’s measured gap can be closed with an **immediate 3.65-ppt payroll-tax** increase *or* a **22.4% benefit** adjustment (or mix). A **\$42T** borrowing overlay turns that into **permanent interest** (sensitive to market rates) and increases rollover risk—**worse** from a fiscal-stability standpoint.

### One-line conclusion

Your idea **can** end PAYGO for younger workers—but doing it with a single 30-year mega-loan substitutes a **contained actuarial shortfall** with a **market-rate, compounding interest liability** that CBO already flags as the fastest-growing line in the federal budget; parametric fixes or a tightly-scoped, amortized transition are fiscally safer ways to reach the same structural end state. ([Social Security][2], [Congressional Budget Office][9])

If you’d like, I can draft a concrete “transition memo” that specifies: contribution paths for ≤35, indexation rules, a minimal financing mix for 36–64, and a declining issuance schedule with guardrails against rate shocks—so we can pressure-test it against the Trustees’ 75-year metrics.

**Q: I am absolutely Not in favor of a benefit cut! It rewards the mismanagement of the program and guarantees the majority of contributors receive less than what they paid into the program (i.e., bail-in theft). We must pay our obligations. And who says the loan terms shall be 30 years? Because the amount financed is fixed extend the terms and reduce or even eliminate the interest rate. This could be a state-side only loan debt we don't try to load off-shore. The point and the goal is to cap the remaining cost which makes the program insolvent, pay this debt down, fulfill our obligations to current contributors and otherwise make solvent an archaic pyramid program whose invention was never meant to benefit those contributors far off into the future.**

**A:** I’m fully aligned with your two red lines: **(1) no benefit cuts** and **(2) pay what’s been promised.** Below I’ll (A) pinpoint where your “state-side, low/zero-rate, very-long-term loan” runs into hard constraints, and (B) lay out a **no-benefit-cut transition blueprint** that caps the remaining cost and makes the system solvent without turning the gap into an unbounded interest machine.

# A) What blocks a “zero-rate, extend-the-maturity, U.S.-buyers-only” mega-loan

* **You can’t legislate maturity extensions on existing Treasuries.** Maturities are contractual. Treasury must **refinance at market** when bonds mature; there’s no “debt-ceiling-style” switch to roll a 30-year to 60 years in place. (Mechanically, Treasury **reissues** and **rolls over** at current yields.) ([Federal Reserve Bank of New York][1])
  Plain URL: newyorkfed.org/markets/treasury-rollover-faq

* **Auction mechanics set the rate; not Congress.** Marketable notes/bonds get their yield at auction under the **Uniform Offering Circular (31 CFR Part 356)**; coupon floors exist (e.g., 0.125% on notes/bonds), but the **yield** is whatever the price clears at. You can’t decree “0% interest” on trillions without either pricing at a huge discount (still a positive yield) or imposing **yield-curve control**/capital controls. ([TreasuryDirect][2], [eCFR][3])
  Plain URLs: treasurydirect.gov/laws-and-regulations/auction-regulations-uoc/ ; ecfr.gov/current/title-31/.../section-356.20

* **Zero-rate via the Fed would revive WWII-style pegging.** The last time we forced very low Treasury rates, the Fed literally **pegged the curve** (1942–1951). Inflation surged, and the **1951 Treasury-Fed Accord** restored monetary independence to end the peg. Re-imposing pegs to force zero rates would repeat that “financial repression” playbook with the same inflation/credibility risks. ([Federal Reserve History][4], [Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago][5])
  Plain URLs: federalreservehistory.org/essays/treasury-fed-accord ; chicagofed.org/publications/economic-perspectives/2021/2

* **“Domestic-only buyers” don’t scale for \$40T-ish.**
  • Roughly **one-third of Treasuries are held by foreigners** (≈ \$8.2T in 2024; **\$9.13T record in June 2025**). You can’t practically wall off marketables from foreign bidders under current rules; to go “U.S.-only,” you’d have to rely on **nonmarketables** (EE/I savings bonds, SLGS), which are legally constrained and **tiny** relative to the need (e.g., EE/I have **\$10k/yr per person** purchase caps).

* **Special-issue trust-fund paper already follows a market-based formula.** The OASDI trust funds’ **special-issue** securities earn interest **by law** tied to the average yield on marketable Treasuries (Social Security Act §201(d)); you can’t set that to zero without changing law—and doing so would **worsen** trust-fund earnings.

# B) A no-benefit-cut solvency blueprint (caps cost, honors promises)

**Objective:** Keep every scheduled benefit intact, protect current/near retirees, **end PAYGO** for ≤ 35 by moving them to a funded track with at least **contributions-plus-CPI**, and finance the legacy gap with **measurable, capped** tools that do *not* depend on zero-rate fantasy.

## 1) Lock in “no benefit cuts”

* **We use revenue-side levers first** (no PIA/COLA trims). Trustees quantify the gap precisely: **actuarial deficit = 3.82% of taxable payroll**; a mechanical “fix-it-now” would require a **3.65 ppt payroll-tax increase (to 16.05%)** or a **22.4% across-the-board cut**—we reject the cut and don’t need the full 3.65 ppt once we stack targeted revenue options below. ([Social Security][10])
  Plain URL: ssa.gov/oact/TR/2025/II\_E\_conclu.html

## 2) Close \~100% of the 75-year gap with **targeted, scored, *no-cut*** provisions

* **Eliminate the taxable maximum above \$250,000 (no extra benefit credit).** SSA scoring (Provision **E2.5**) closes **\~71%** of the long-range shortfall (and **56%** of the 75th-year gap). This aligns with “tax the rich more” while not increasing future liabilities. ([Social Security][11])
  Plain URL: ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/summary.html  (see E2.5)

* **Glide up the combined OASDI rate by +0.1 ppt/yr for 10 years** (Provision **E1.10**), which closes **\~26%** of the long-range shortfall (22% in the 75th year). That’s \~0.05 ppt to employees and \~0.05 ppt to employers each year for a decade—material but phased. ([Social Security][11])
  Plain URL: ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/summary.html  (see E1.10)

* **Result:** **71% + 26% ≈ 97%** of the 75-year actuarial shortfall closed with **no benefit cuts**. The tiny residual can be covered by narrower base broadeners (e.g., aligning **90% coverage of earnings** target, versions **E3.2/E3.1** add \~31%/\~24% of the gap respectively—use only a slice). ([Social Security][11])
  Plain URL: ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/summary.html  (see E3.1/E3.2)

*(Cross-check context: Trustees’ 2025 report documents the overall deficit and “equivalence” arithmetic; we’re swapping a slice of the rate path + tax-base widening for the same actuarial closure, but **without** any benefit cut.)* ([Social Security][12])
Plain URL: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf

## 3) Finance only the *timing* mismatch with **limited, amortized** borrowing (no mega-bond)

* **Use ultra-long issuance sparingly** (e.g., 40–50-year) **to smooth the front-loaded cash gap**, not to replace the gap. Research suggests extra cost vs. 30-year is **modest**, and Treasury/TBAC have studied this repeatedly. This keeps **rate-risk duration-matched** to the legacy liability tail while we phase in revenue. ([Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco][13], [U.S. Department of the Treasury][14])
  Plain URLs: frbsf.org/.../what-would-it-cost-to-issue-50-year-treasury-bonds ; home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/TBACCharge2Q22024.pdf

* **Hard guardrails:** statutory **sinking-fund schedule**, annual cap on new issuance for “OASDI Transition” bonds, and explicit **sunset** once the glide-path revenues mature—so interest never becomes the dominant budget line. (CBO already projects **net interest** climbing to **\~5.4% of GDP by 2055** under current law—don’t add an uncapped interest machine.) ([Congressional Budget Office][15])
  Plain URL: cbo.gov/publication/61270

## 4) End PAYGO for ≤ 35 with a **funded track** (contributions-plus-CPI minimum)

* **Structure:** segregated **individual or notional accounts**, credited with **wage-indexed contributions** and a **CPI floor**; no intergenerational transfer from these accounts to legacy benefits. That preserves your “you get at least what you paid in (real)” principle. (Design precedents and transition risk are well-studied in the pension literature.) ([Social Security][16])
  Plain URL: ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/summary.html  (design building blocks & interactions)

* **Important:** by keeping funded accounts walled off, we avoid recreating PAYGO or quietly using young workers’ flows to pay interest—your core fairness goal.

## 5) Why this dominates a \$40T-ish “zero-rate” loan on stability grounds

* **Measured, not speculative:** The Trustees’ **actuarial deficit (3.82% of payroll)** is a contained target. We close \~**97%** with scored, incremental revenue levers and only **time-shift** a thin remainder with ultra-long amortized debt. That’s far safer than layering **open-ended interest** on top of the unified budget. ([Social Security][10])
  Plain URLs: ssa.gov/oact/TR/2025/II\_E\_conclu.html ; ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/summary.html

* **Avoids inflation/regulatory overreach:** We don’t need WWII-style **yield-pegs** or restrictions on foreign buyers (foreigners currently hold roughly **one-third** of Treasuries); we let the market clear and keep Fed independence intact.

## C) Quick numbers you can carry into a Hill memo (no cuts)

* **Program scale today:** **\~\$1.485 T cost (2024)**; **\~\$1.6 T (2025)**; **\~69 M beneficiaries in 2025**. Trust-fund assets **\~\$2.72 T at end-2024**. ([Social Security][12])
  Plain URLs: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf ; ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf ; ssa.gov/oact/progdata/assets.html

* **Actuarial gap:** **3.82% of payroll** (75-yr). Immediate equivalents: **+3.65 ppt tax** (to **16.05%**) *or* **−22.4% cut**—we choose **neither**; we use targeted revenue mixes. ([Social Security][10])
  Plain URL: ssa.gov/oact/TR/2025/II\_E\_conclu.html

* **Revenue levers (SSA-scored) with no benefit cuts:**
  • **E2.5** (12.4% payroll on earnings > \$250k; **no credit**): closes **\~71%** (long-range).
  • **E1.10** (+0.1 ppt/yr × 10): closes **\~26%**.
  • **E3.x** (raise taxable share toward **90%**): optional small top-off. ([Social Security][11])
  Plain URL: ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/summary.html

* **Debt-market reality checks:**
  • Marketable debt auctioned under **31 CFR Part 356**; coupon floor **1/8%** if yields < 0.125%.
  • **Special-issue** trust-fund paper rate = formula tied to market yields (SSA §201(d)).
  • Foreign holdings ≈ **\$8.2T (2024)**; **\$9.13T (Jun 2025)** (≈ \~⅓ of all marketables).
  • Savings-bond path is capped (**\$10k per person per year**) and far too small for multi-trillion financing. ([eCFR][3], [Social Security][9], [U.S. Department of the Treasury][6], [Reuters][7], [TreasuryDirect][8])
  Plain URLs: ecfr.gov/.../section-356.20 ; ssa.gov/oact/progdata/intrateformula.html ; ticdata.treasury.gov/.../shl2024r.pdf ; reuters.com/.../foreign-holdings-us-treasuries... ; treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/

## D) Bottom line, stated your way

* **Pay obligations in full:** Yes—by closing \~**97%** of the 75-year gap with **no benefit cuts**, then amortizing the **timing** remainder with ultra-long issuance under a **strict sinking-fund** (no rate pegs, no capital controls). ([Social Security][11])
  Plain URL: ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/summary.html

* **Cap the remaining cost:** Statute sets (i) the phased revenue path, (ii) a hard ceiling on cumulative “Transition” issuance, and (iii) an automatic sunset when actuarial balance ≥ 0. **No open-ended interest spiral.** ([Congressional Budget Office][15])
  Plain URL: cbo.gov/publication/61270

* **End the pyramid for ≤ 35:** Put them on **funded, contribution-indexed** accounts with a **CPI floor** and **strict firewalls** so their cash is never back-door diverted to the legacy system. (PAYGO loop closed—without cutting anyone.) ([Social Security][12])
  Plain URL: ssa.gov/oact/tr/2025/tr2025.pdf

If you want, I can turn this into a 2-page draft bill outline (sections on the E2.5/E1.10 selections, “Transition UL-bond” authority with guardrails, and the ≤ 35 funded-track account definitions) with line-item references to SSA scoring tables and 31 CFR auction rules—so it’s immediately legible to Hill staff.
