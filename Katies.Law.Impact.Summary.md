**Q:** How has Katie's Law impacted New Mexico's unsolved cases since its inception ?

**A:** Katie’s Law, officially known as the Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2010, was enacted in New Mexico in 2006, following the brutal murder of Katie Sepich in 2003. The law mandates the collection of DNA samples from individuals arrested for certain felony crimes, rather than waiting for conviction. The DNA is then uploaded to national databases like CODIS (Combined DNA Index System) to help solve current and past cases. The law was later expanded to include all felony arrests, and other states adopted similar measures.

Since its inception, Katie’s Law has had a significant impact on New Mexico’s ability to solve cold cases and reduce the number of unsolved crimes. Some key impacts include:

1. Increase in Cold Case Resolutions

	•	New Mexico has been able to solve several cold cases as DNA collected under Katie’s Law linked individuals to crimes that occurred years prior.
	•	For example, the murder of Wendy Blair in 1986 was solved in 2010 when the DNA of an arrested individual matched evidence collected from the crime scene.

2. Reduction in Investigation Time

	•	The law has allowed law enforcement to quickly identify suspects in cases where DNA evidence is present, reducing the time and resources needed to solve crimes.
	•	DNA hits through CODIS provide investigators with leads early in the process, helping to accelerate investigations.

3. Improved Crime Prevention

	•	By identifying suspects early in their criminal careers, New Mexico has seen a potential reduction in the number of violent crimes committed by repeat offenders.
	•	Those arrested for lesser crimes, such as burglary, have been linked to more serious crimes like rape or murder, helping prevent further offenses.

4. Expansion of the DNA Database

	•	New Mexico’s DNA database has expanded significantly since Katie’s Law was passed. As of the latest reports, hundreds of thousands of DNA profiles have been added to CODIS, increasing the likelihood of solving both recent and past crimes.
	•	More DNA matches have occurred as a result of the larger pool of DNA samples.

5. Challenges and Ethical Considerations

	•	While the law has been effective, it has also faced challenges, including concerns over privacy rights and the potential for racial profiling in felony arrests.
	•	Legal debates continue about the balance between public safety and individual rights, especially in cases where arrestees are later exonerated.

6. Impact on Unsolved Cases

	•	Data suggests that many unsolved violent crimes, particularly rapes and homicides, have been closed through the use of DNA collected under the law. However, the exact number of cases impacted remains difficult to quantify, as it is influenced by ongoing investigations and the availability of DNA evidence.

Overall, Katie’s Law has greatly enhanced New Mexico’s forensic capabilities, helping to solve cold cases and improve law enforcement’s ability to apprehend and convict criminals. However, ongoing analysis is needed to fully assess its long-term impact on the state’s unsolved cases.
