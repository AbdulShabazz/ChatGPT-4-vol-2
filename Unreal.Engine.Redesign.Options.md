As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, redesigning the entire Unreal Engine Editor UI involves understanding both the capabilities of Unreal’s plugin system and the architecture of the engine itself. Here’s a comprehensive overview:

1. Using Plugins for UI Customization

Unreal Engine’s Plugin System allows developers to extend and modify the editor’s functionality without altering the engine’s core source code. Through plugins, you can:

•	**Add New Panels and Tools**: Create custom windows, panels, and tools that integrate seamlessly with the existing editor UI using the Slate framework and Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG).  
•	**Modify Existing UI Elements**: Enhance or tweak existing UI components to better fit your workflow or project needs.  
•	**Extend Editor Functionality**: Implement new features that can coexist with the standard editor interface, providing additional capabilities without overhauling the entire UI.  

Advantages of Using Plugins:

  •	**Maintainability**: Plugins are easier to maintain and update, especially when upgrading Unreal Engine versions.  
	•	**Modularity**: They allow for selective activation, enabling or disabling specific UI customizations as needed.  
	•	**Community and Marketplace Support**: Utilize existing plugins or share your custom plugins with the Unreal community.  

Limitations:

•	**Scope of Changes**: While plugins are powerful, they might not offer the flexibility required for a complete UI overhaul. They are best suited for adding or modifying specific parts of the UI rather than redesigning it entirely.

2. Modifying the Engine’s Source Code

For comprehensive UI redesigns, you might need to delve into Unreal Engine’s source code. Here’s why and how:

  •	**Access to Core UI Components**: The engine’s source code provides full access to all UI components, allowing you to restructure or replace them as needed.  
	•	**Deep Customization**: Implementing a completely new UI layout, behavior, or aesthetics that aren’t supported by plugins requires changes at the source level.  
	•	**Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune the UI for specific performance or functionality requirements beyond what plugins can achieve.  

Steps to Modify the Source Code:

	1.	Obtain the Source Code: Access Unreal Engine’s source code via Epic Games’ GitHub repository, which requires an Epic Games account linked to GitHub.
	2.	Set Up Your Development Environment: Ensure you have the necessary tools installed, such as Visual Studio for Windows or Xcode for macOS.
	3.	Understand the UI Architecture: Familiarize yourself with Unreal’s Slate framework and how the editor’s UI is constructed.
	4.	Implement Your Redesign: Make the desired changes, ensuring that they integrate smoothly with existing functionalities.
	5.	Maintain Your Custom Engine: Keep your modified version updated with the latest Unreal Engine releases to benefit from improvements and security updates.

Considerations:

  •	**Maintenance Overhead**: Custom modifications to the engine’s source code can complicate updates and require ongoing maintenance.  
	•	**Complexity**: Understanding and modifying the engine’s core can be challenging and time-consuming.  
	•	**License Compliance**: Ensure that your modifications comply with Unreal Engine’s licensing agreements.  

3. Hybrid Approach

In many cases, a hybrid approach—using plugins for as much customization as possible and resorting to source code modifications for areas that plugins can’t address—can be effective. This strategy balances maintainability with the need for deeper customization.

Conclusion

  •	**Plugins** are powerful for extending and customizing specific parts of the Unreal Engine Editor UI, allowing for significant enhancements without touching the core engine.  
	•	**For a complete UI redesign**, modifying the engine’s source code is likely necessary to achieve the desired level of customization and control.  

Recommendation: Start by exploring what can be achieved with plugins, as this path is generally more maintainable and less complex. If you find that plugins don’t meet your requirements for a complete UI overhaul, then consider diving into the engine’s source code, keeping in mind the additional responsibilities that come with maintaining a custom engine version.

Always refer to the official Unreal Engine documentation and the Unreal Engine Community for the latest guidance and best practices related to UI customization.
