**Q: I repeatedly hear Lucid mention a Lucid Gravity Dream edition however I find no such trimline on their website.**

**A:** It exists. Lucid is building a limited-run Gravity **Dream Edition**, but it’s allocation/invite–only and not surfaced on the public trims page or standard configurator. Lucid’s own offer footnotes explicitly name “Gravity Grand Touring or **Dream Edition**,” confirming availability even if the website doesn’t list it as a normal trim. See `https://lucidmotors.com/offers`. ([Home | Lucid Motors][1])

Evidence and specs:

* **Official mention (fine print):** “For U.S. customers leasing a new Lucid Gravity Grand Touring or **Dream Edition** only.” See `https://lucidmotors.com/offers`. ([Home | Lucid Motors][1])
* **Independent instrumented test:** Car and Driver tested the **2026 Gravity Dream Edition**, calling it a “limited-edition Dream model.” Base price **\$141,550**; **1,070 hp**, **909 lb-ft**, **123-kWh** pack, **400-kW** DC fast-charge peak; **0–60 in 3.1 s**, **¼-mile 10.6 s @ 140 mph**, **EPA 378 mi** on the tested spec. See `https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a65577911/2026-lucid-gravity-dream-edition-test/`. ([Car and Driver][2])
* **Trim lineup including Dream Edition:** Car and Driver’s model page lists **Touring**, **Grand Touring**, and **Dream Edition** with pricing guidance. See `https://www.caranddriver.com/lucid-motors/gravity`. ([Car and Driver][3])
* **Why it’s not on the main site:** When Lucid opened orders, it publicly emphasized **Grand Touring** (and later Touring), which explains the site focus; Dream Edition has been handled by allocation and limited batches. See `https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lucid-gravity-now-available-configure-and-order-lucid-motors`. ([Lucid Motors Investor Relations][4])

Bottom line: Dream Edition is real, very limited, and handled off the main trims flow. If you’re not seeing it in your account configurator, you likely don’t have an active DE allocation. Car and Driver’s tested specs and Lucid’s offers page are the clean confirmations above. ([Car and Driver][2], [Home | Lucid Motors][1], [Lucid Motors Investor Relations][4])

**Q: And what of the Lucid Gravity X?**

**A:** It is a **concept**, not a production trim. Announced August 2025 as an off-road-oriented build of the Gravity **Grand Touring** shown at Monterey Car Week. No pricing. No orderability. No published production plan. `https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lucid-gravity-x-concept-trail-ready-suv-designed-push-boundaries` ([Lucid Motors Investor Relations][1])

Key facts

* Purpose: preview a “trail-ready” Gravity. Based on the **Gravity Grand Touring** platform. `https://media.lucidmotors.com/en/newsitem/1042-lucid-gravity-x-concept-a-trail-ready-suv-designed-to-push-boundaries-and-redefine-adventure` ([Lucid Motors][2])
* Debut: private reveal and public display at Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance during Monterey Car Week, Aug 14–17, 2025. `https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lucid-gravity-x-concept-a-trail-ready-suv-designed-to-push-boundaries-and-redefine-adventure-302530509.html` ([PR Newswire][3])

* Official positioning: “celebrates” Gravity capability; shown as a design/ideas exercise. `https://lucidmotors.com/stories/lucid-gravity-x-concept-monterey` ([Home | Lucid Motors][6])
* Production status: media notes say unclear if a production X will follow. `https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/lucid-gravity-x-concept-debut-first-look.html` ([Edmunds][7])

Why you don’t see it on trims

* Lucid’s public Gravity page lists production models only; **X** is a show concept, so it is absent from the configurator. `https://lucidmotors.com/gravity` ([Home | Lucid Motors][8])

Context vs. Dream Edition

* **Gravity Dream Edition** = limited production trim handled by allocation. **Gravity X** = off-road **concept**. Different things. `https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a65577911/2026-lucid-gravity-dream-edition-test/` `https://lucidmotors.com/offers` ([Car and Driver][5], [Home | Lucid Motors][6])

If Lucid greenlights a production variant, it will appear first on the press-releases page. `https://ir.lucidmotors.com/press-releases` ([Lucid Motors Investor Relations][9])
