**Q:** In Unreal Engine rather than every actor querying event tick is it more efficient to construct a central time/timer/timed carousel and have actors (in a threadsafe manner) write- and read- tags as needed to and from the carousel respectively ?

**A:** In Unreal Engine, relying on `Event Tick` for every actor can indeed lead to performance bottlenecks, especially if there are many actors in the scene. The `Event Tick` function runs every frame, so when many actors use it to perform small updates, it can cause overhead due to numerous function calls and logic checks being performed constantly. To improve performance and reduce unnecessary calls, a **centralized timer system** can be an excellent approach.

### Benefits of a Centralized Timer System (Carousel):
1. **Reduced Overhead**:
   - Centralizing time-related operations reduces the number of `Event Tick` calls, minimizing function call overhead per actor.
   - You consolidate time-based operations into a single thread-safe system that can efficiently manage timed events without querying every actor individually.

2. **Event-Driven Approach**:
   - Rather than each actor continuously polling for time changes (which is inherently inefficient), actors could register with a central system and subscribe to specific timed events. The carousel can notify actors only when necessary.
   - This approach minimizes unnecessary computation and leverages **event-driven programming** principles, where actors are updated only when certain thresholds or time intervals are met.

3. **Thread-Safety**:
   - By making this system thread-safe, actors could write and read their tags in a controlled manner. This can be done using **mutexes**, **locks**, or Unreal’s **concurrent data structures**, ensuring that data races are avoided in multi-threaded environments.

4. **Tag-Based Scheduling**:
   - Actors could write "tags" (representing timing requests or actions) into the carousel system and retrieve necessary timing updates as needed. This allows for **custom scheduling** based on the actors' needs, instead of relying on frame-by-frame updates.
   - Tags could represent:
     - Specific events or timeouts.
     - States the actor needs to be notified about.
     - Game mechanics that need synchronization (e.g., cool-downs, animations, physics events).

5. **Efficient Handling of Different Time Intervals**:
   - Not all actors need to be updated at the same frequency. Some actors may require updates every frame (like player-controlled entities), while others might only need updates every few seconds (like environmental objects). A centralized timer system could be optimized to handle these **different timing intervals**, whereas `Event Tick` operates uniformly for all actors.

6. **Simplified Control Over Game Time**:
   - A centralized system provides a unified way to control time-based operations, making it easier to handle things like **game pausing, slowing down time**, or other time manipulation mechanics.

7. **Lower Memory and CPU Usage**:
   - Because fewer actors are running independent `Event Tick` calls, this approach can significantly reduce CPU load and memory footprint, especially in scenes with a large number of actors or complex simulations.

### Potential Implementation Approach:
- **Timer Carousel**:
  - Create a timer manager or carousel system that keeps track of global time.
  - Actors register with this system when they need time-based updates.
  - The system schedules actor updates based on tags, timestamps, or event thresholds.
  
- **Thread-Safe Synchronization**:
  - Use Unreal Engine’s thread-safe structures like `TQueue`, `FRWLock`, or `TAtomic` to manage shared access to the time carousel.
  - Ensure that actors can safely register and deregister themselves from the system without introducing race conditions.

- **Granularity of Updates**:
  - The carousel could manage timers at different levels of granularity (e.g., per second, per frame, etc.). Actors could specify how often they need to be updated, allowing the system to be more selective about how often it processes each actor's requests.

### Trade-Offs:
- **Complexity**:
   - While this system introduces efficiency, it adds complexity in terms of managing and maintaining a centralized system.
  
- **Latency**:
   - Depending on how the timers are structured, there might be small latencies in triggering events compared to `Event Tick`, where updates are frame-locked. However, for most applications, this is usually negligible.

- **Scalability**:
   - A well-optimized central system will scale much better with a higher number of actors than the default `Event Tick` system.

In summary, constructing a central time carousel and having actors interact with it in a thread-safe manner can be much more efficient than relying on `Event Tick` for each actor, especially when the number of actors and time-based operations in the scene increases. This approach promotes an event-driven architecture that allows actors to only perform necessary updates when specific conditions are met, optimizing both CPU and memory usage.
