**Q: How do scientists surmise constituents of the Earth's core?**

**A:** Here’s how scientists infer what’s in Earth’s core—using multiple, independent lines of evidence that cross-check one another.

* **Seismic wave behavior (travel times, “shadow zones,” normal modes)**
  * **Fact**: Shear waves (S-waves) vanish in the outer core, while compressional waves (P-waves) slow and refract strongly—creating P-wave and S-wave shadow zones. This requires a liquid outer core. (P-shadow \~104°–140°; S-waves absent beyond \~104°). Source: IRIS education page — “Seismic Shadow Zone” — iris.edu/hq/inclass/animation/seismic\_shadow\_zone\_basic\_introduction and USGS primer — usgs.gov/media/images/p-wave-and-s-wave-paths-through-earth. ([Iris][1], [USGS][2])
  * **Fact**: In contrast, certain seismic phases show the inner core transmits shear energy ⇒ it’s solid.

  * **Numbers**: Core–mantle boundary (CMB) depth ≈ 2,891 km; inner-core radius ≈ 1,221 km; outer-core radius ≈ 3,480 km. These come from the PREM reference model built by inverting \~1,000 free-oscillation periods + \~500 travel-time data sets (+ mass & moment-of-inertia constraints). Sources: Dziewoński & Anderson (1981) PREM — lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/\~lzeng/papers/PREM.pdf; IRIS PREM dataset page — ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-prem/. ([Center for Astrophysics][5], [IRIS][6])
  * **Extra constraints**: Free oscillations (normal modes) observed after great earthquakes (e.g., 1960 Chile) constrain radial density and elasticity, tightening core size/composition models. Sources: USGS/Caltech notes on free oscillations — pubs.usgs.gov/of/2010/1152/presentations/of2010-1152\_20100719d\_kanamori.pdf; Elsevier Treatise chapter on Earth’s free oscillations — booksite.elsevier.com/brochures/geophysics/PDFs/00002.pdf. ([U.S. Geological Survey][7], [Elsevier Shop][8])

* **Whole-Earth mass & moment-of-inertia (MoI) constraints**
  * **Fact**: Earth’s normalized polar MoI factor C/(MR²) ≈ 0.3307–0.3308 (well below the uniform-sphere value 0.4), proving mass is concentrated centrally and requiring a dense metallic core. Sources: NASA/academic fact sheets listing Earth’s MoI — atoc.colorado.edu/\~fasullo/1060/resources/earthfact.html; Venus spin paper noting Earth’s C/MR²=0.3307 — ntrs.nasa.gov (lod\_arxiv.pdf); Princeton Univ. Press excerpt on MoI & interior mass distribution — assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7559.pdf. ([Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences][9], [NASA Technical Reports Server][10], [Princeton University Press][11])
  * These **bulk constraints** must be matched by any interior model (e.g., PREM), jointly with seismic observations. Source: PREM paper — lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/\~lzeng/papers/PREM.pdf. ([Center for Astrophysics][5])

* **Cosmochemical baselines (meteorites & “bulk Earth” models)**
  * **Approach**: Use chondritic meteorites (esp. enstatite chondrites) and siderophile-element budgets to estimate Earth’s starting composition; metal–silicate partitioning during core formation then predicts which “light elements” (low-Z) accompany Fe–Ni into the core. Sources: McDonough & Sun review — sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0009254194001404; Javoy et al. (E-chondrite model) — sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X10001445; Rubie et al. (accretion + differentiation modeling) — arxiv.org/abs/1410.3509. ([ScienceDirect][12], [arXiv][13])

* **High-pressure experiments & ab-initio physics (Fe-alloy equations of state, sound speeds, melting)**
  * **Fact**: Seismology demands the core be mostly Fe–Ni, but with a “density deficit” relative to pure iron at core P–T ⇒ requires dissolved light elements (O, Si, S, C, H). Typical deficits: \~5–10% in the liquid outer core; \~2–5% in the solid inner core. Sources: Badro et al., PNAS 2014 (compositional fits to seismology) — ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4040578/; Nature Rev. (Hirose et al., 2021) — discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10134605/; Science Advances 2023 (inner-core deficit may be larger than thought) — science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh8706. ([PMC][14], [UCL Discovery][15], [Science][16])
  * **Candidate amounts (illustrative, model-dependent)**: several wt% total light elements, often partitioned as O+Si (a few wt% each) and minor S and/or C; H likely trace. Example estimates from partitioning/elasticity fits: \~8–9 wt% Si and \~2–4 wt% O in aggregate models of the core; outer-core density \~8% below pure Fe at P–T.

  * **Melting curve & temperature constraints**: Inner-core boundary conditions anchor Fe melting at \~330 GPa; experiments and DFT set core temperatures and phase relations of Fe-alloys. Sources: Sinmyo et al., EPSL 2019 (Fe melting to 290 GPa) — sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X19300160; Hou et al., GRL 2021 (resistivity jump at melting) — agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL095739; Zhang et al., EPSL 2016 — sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X16301984. ([ScienceDirect][19], [AGU Publications][20])
  * **Sound speeds & texture**: Inner-core seismic anisotropy (P-waves \~3% faster along spin axis) is consistent with textured hcp-Fe alloy and helps bound compositions/structures. Sources: Song & Helmberger 1993/1995; reviews on inner-core anisotropy—Caltech/AGU summaries — authors.library.caltech.edu/records/cpkne-psk62/preview/TROareps01.pdf; agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/97RG01285. ([CaltechAUTHORS][21], [AGU Publications][22])

* **Geodynamo, conductivity, and heat-flow budgets**
  * **Fact**: Earth’s magnetic field requires an electrically conductive, convecting liquid iron alloy. Core thermal/electrical conductivity at P–T governs whether thermal and/or compositional convection can sustain the dynamo and constrains light-element inventory. First-principles computations and experiments suggest high conductivity for Fe-alloys at core conditions, though values and implications are debated. Sources: Pozzo et al., Nature 2012 — pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22495307/ (and arXiv: arxiv.org/abs/1203.4970); de Koker et al., PNAS 2012 — ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306690/; Hsieh et al., Nat. Comm. 2020 (Si lowers k) — nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17106-7. ([PubMed][23], [PMC][24], [Nature][25])
  * **Heat-flow scale**: geophysical estimates typically span a few to \~15 TW across the CMB; higher Fe conductivity implies more stringent power requirements unless light-element chemistry reduces k. Representative bounds and debate: Davies 2007 (≈12 ± 5 TW); Pozzo et al. 2012 (adiabatic flux 15–16 TW); Hsieh et al. 2020 (Si-rich alloys could allow ≲\~3–5 TW). Sources: sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031920106003086; arxiv.org/abs/1203.4970; nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17106-7. ([ScienceDirect][26], [arXiv][27], [Nature][25])

* **Putting it together (what the evidence implies)**
  * **Structure**: a solid inner core (Fe-Ni alloy + a few wt% light elements) inside a liquid outer core (Fe-Ni alloy + several wt% light elements), bounded by the CMB at \~2,891 km depth. These sizes/densities are set primarily by seismology (travel-times + normal modes) under global mass/MoI constraints. Source: PREM paper and summaries — lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/\~lzeng/papers/PREM.pdf; ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-prem/. ([Center for Astrophysics][5], [IRIS][6])
  * **Composition (consensus range, still debated)**:
  – **Dominant metals**: Fe with \~5–10 wt% Ni.
  – **Light elements (outer core)**: mixtures of O, Si, S, with possible C and trace H; total light-element content commonly modeled at \~5–10 wt% (outer), somewhat less in the inner core (because some elements—e.g., O—partition into the liquid during inner-core freezing). Sources: Badro et al., PNAS 2014 — ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4040578/; Hirose et al., Nat. Rev. Earth & Env. 2021 — discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10134605/; Ricolleau et al., EPSL 2011 — sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X11004596.

Why this works (method summary, keyword breadcrumbs: seismic shadow zones; PREM; density deficit; Fe-alloy equations-of-state; diamond-anvil/shock; normal modes; MoI; geodynamo; CMB heat flow; cosmochemistry/chondrites; partitioning):  

Scientists synthesize  
(1) seismology (wave speeds, attenuation, anisotropy, normal-mode spectra),  
(2) global geodesy (mass, shape, spin, MoI),  
(3) cosmochemical starting compositions and metal-silicate partitioning, and  
(4) high-P/T mineral physics (equations-of-state, melting, transport of Fe-alloys). The only compositions that simultaneously fit the seismic densities/velocities, Earth’s bulk mass & MoI, and the magnetic/heat-flow constraints are Fe–Ni alloys with a modest admixture of light elements (O, Si, S ± C ± H), in liquid form in the outer core and solid form in the inner core. Sources embedded above (PREM; USGS/IRIS; Badro 2014; Hirose 2021; Pozzo 2012; de Koker 2012; Davies 2007).

If you’d like, I can turn these into a compact spec-table (layers, depth, density, light-element ranges, seismic speeds) or sketch a PREM-style profile to keep alongside your notes.
