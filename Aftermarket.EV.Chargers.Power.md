**Q: Are there aftermarket EV chargers that deliver more than 11KWh of energy?** 

**A:** Yes, there are aftermarket EV chargers that deliver more than **11 kW** of power. Here’s a breakdown of your options:

### **Level 2 AC Chargers (>11 kW)**
Most aftermarket **Level 2** chargers max out at **11 kW (48A at 240V)**, but a few go beyond:
- **Tesla Wall Connector (Gen 3, with legacy cars)** – **Up to 19.2 kW** (80A at 240V) if your Tesla supports it.
- **ClipperCreek HCS-100** – **Up to 19.2 kW** (80A at 240V).
- **Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite** – **Up to 12 kW** (50A at 240V).
- **EVoCharge 80A** – **Up to 19.2 kW** (80A at 240V), requires an 80A breaker.
  
**Limitation:** Your EV must support **AC charging at higher than 11 kW**, which is often restricted in non-Tesla vehicles.

### **Level 3 DC Fast Chargers (Aftermarket)**
These are direct **DC fast chargers** (DCFC) and can deliver **well above 11 kW**, typically **up to 350 kW**:
- **ABB Terra DC Wallbox** – **Up to 24 kW DC** (small footprint, great for home use if your vehicle supports DC charging).
- **Emporia DCFC 30kW** – **Up to 30 kW DC** (CCS or CHAdeMO).
- **ChargePoint Express 250** – **Up to 62.5 kW DC** (commercial-grade but sometimes used in private settings).
- **Wallbox Supernova** – **Up to 60 kW DC**.

**Considerations for Home Use:**
1. **Power Supply Requirements** – DC chargers require **three-phase power** (rare for residential use).
2. **Cost** – DC fast chargers start at **$10,000+**, whereas high-power AC chargers remain under **$1,500**.
3. **EV Compatibility** – Not all EVs accept **DC charging at home**, even if you install one.

For a residential setting, **19.2 kW AC (80A at 240V) is the max practical limit**, unless you have access to **commercial or industrial-grade three-phase power** for **DC fast charging**.
