**Q: Explain the XP crowns in Youtube LIVE chat!**

**A:** XP crowns in YouTube Live chat are part of YouTube’s new “engagement leaderboard” system. They represent your accumulated experience points (XP) for that creator’s live stream and link to a ranking of the most active viewers.

Core behavior:

* XP = “experience points” for engagement.

  * You earn XP by:

    * Sending live chat messages
    * Sending Super Chats
    * Sending Super Stickers
    * Gifting memberships (currently limited to some regions/vertical lives) ([Google Help][1])
* Crown icon at top of chat:

  * The crown with an XP number is your current XP for that stream/channel.
  * Clicking the crown opens a leaderboard showing the top 50 most engaged viewers on that live stream. ([Google Help][1])
* Badges in chat:

  * The top 3 viewers on the leaderboard get a special badge next to their name in live chat.
  * Badges are dynamic: if your rank changes, the badge can move to another viewer.
  * When the stream ends, badges go away; they are not permanent. ([Google Help][1])

Scope and eligibility:

* This is still a newer / experimental feature, not on all channels or for all viewers yet. ([Storyy][2])
* Only viewers age 18+ participate in the leaderboard XP system. ([Google Help][1])

Opting out:

* Viewers can disable appearing on the leaderboard:

  * YouTube app → “You” tab → Settings → Live Chat → toggle off “Leaderboard participation.” ([Google Help][1])

Practical summary:

* If you see a crown with an XP number: that’s your engagement score for that stream.
* Higher XP = higher position on the leaderboard; top 3 get a visible badge in chat for that stream only.
