**Q:** In an FPS template, Unreal Engine project, I've created an input action, IA_ToggleCamera, and assigned a shortcut key, C, to the action. I've them associated the input action to an input mapping context, IMC_InputMappinContext_v2! What steps are now required to assign third person camera view functionality to the first person view project ? I have the main character blueprint, BP_FirstPersonCharacter, and a second unconfigured blueprint, BP_ThirdPersonCharacter, on standby.

**A:** To add third-person camera view functionality to your first-person project and toggle between the two views using the 'C' key, follow these detailed steps:

### **Step 1: Add a Third-Person Camera to Your Character Blueprint**

1. **Open BP_FirstPersonCharacter:**
   - Navigate to your `BP_FirstPersonCharacter` blueprint and open it in the editor.

2. **Add a SpringArm Component:**
   - In the Components panel, click **Add Component** and select **SpringArm**. Name it `ThirdPersonSpringArm`.
   - Attach the `ThirdPersonSpringArm` to the character's root component or mesh.

3. **Configure the SpringArm:**
   - Set the **Target Arm Length** to a suitable value (e.g., 300 units) to position the camera behind the character.
   - Enable **Use Pawn Control Rotation** to allow the camera to rotate with the character's input.
   - Optionally, adjust other settings like **Socket Offset** to fine-tune the camera position.

4. **Add a Third-Person Camera:**
   - With the `ThirdPersonSpringArm` selected, click **Add Component** and select **Camera**. Name it `ThirdPersonCamera`.
   - The camera will automatically attach to the spring arm.

### **Step 2: Create a Boolean Variable to Track Camera State**

1. **Add a New Variable:**
   - In the **My Blueprint** panel, click the **+** button next to **Variables**.
   - Name the variable `bIsFirstPerson` and set its type to **Boolean**.
   - Set the default value to **True** (since the game starts in first-person view).

### **Step 3: Set Up the Input Action in the Character's Event Graph**

1. **Access the Event Graph:**
   - Go to the **Event Graph** tab in `BP_FirstPersonCharacter`.

2. **Add the Input Action Event:**
   - Right-click on the graph and search for your input action `IA_ToggleCamera`.
   - Select the **IA_ToggleCamera** event node.

### **Step 4: Implement the Logic to Toggle Cameras**

1. **Toggle the Boolean Variable:**
   - From the **Triggered** pin of the `IA_ToggleCamera` node, add a **FlipFlop** node or use a **Set** node to toggle `bIsFirstPerson`:
     - **FlipFlop** Node Method:
       - Connect the **Triggered** pin to a **FlipFlop** node.
       - On **A**, set `bIsFirstPerson` to **False**.
       - On **B**, set `bIsFirstPerson` to **True**.
     - **Set Node Method:**
       - Use a **Set** node to set `bIsFirstPerson` to the opposite of its current value using the **Not Boolean** node.

2. **Switch Active Cameras:**
   - Add a **Branch** node after updating `bIsFirstPerson`.
   - Connect `bIsFirstPerson` to the **Condition** pin of the **Branch** node.
   - **If True (First-Person View):**
     - Use the **Set Active** node to activate `FirstPersonCamera` and deactivate `ThirdPersonCamera`.
   - **If False (Third-Person View):**
     - Use the **Set Active** node to activate `ThirdPersonCamera` and deactivate `FirstPersonCamera`.

   **Blueprint Example:**

   ```plaintext
   IA_ToggleCamera (Triggered) → Toggle bIsFirstPerson
                                ↓
                             Branch
                   True                False
                    ↓                    ↓
   Set Active FirstPersonCamera (True)   Set Active FirstPersonCamera (False)
   Set Active ThirdPersonCamera (False)  Set Active ThirdPersonCamera (True)
   ```

### **Step 5: Ensure Only One Camera Is Active at Start**

1. **Set Initial Camera Activation:**
   - In the **Begin Play** event of your character blueprint, ensure that only the `FirstPersonCamera` is active at the start of the game:
     - Use **Set Active** nodes to activate `FirstPersonCamera` and deactivate `ThirdPersonCamera`.

### **Step 6: Test the Functionality**

1. **Compile and Save:**
   - Click **Compile** and **Save** in the blueprint editor.

2. **Test in Play Mode:**
   - Start the game.
   - Press the 'C' key to toggle between first-person and third-person views.
   - Ensure that the character controls and camera perspectives switch as expected.

### **Optional: Adjust Camera Settings for Better Experience**

- **Third-Person Camera Collision:**
  - Enable **Do Collision Test** on the `ThirdPersonSpringArm` to prevent the camera from clipping through walls.

- **Camera Transition Effects:**
  - For smoother transitions, you can use the **Set View Target with Blend** node to interpolate between cameras.

### **Notes:**

- **Using a Single Character Blueprint:**
  - It's more efficient to use one character blueprint with multiple cameras rather than switching between two separate character blueprints.
  - This approach keeps all character-related logic in one place and avoids complexities with pawn possession.

- **BP_ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint:**
  - Since you have an unconfigured `BP_ThirdPersonCharacter`, you can disregard it for this functionality.
  - Alternatively, you can merge any unique features from `BP_ThirdPersonCharacter` into `BP_FirstPersonCharacter` if needed.

### **Summary**

By adding a third-person camera to your existing character blueprint and setting up input logic to toggle between cameras, you enable players to switch views seamlessly during gameplay. This method is straightforward and keeps your project's architecture clean and maintainable.
