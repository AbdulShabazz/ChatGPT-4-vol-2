**Q:** Jupyter notebooks and cells evaluate, for example, Python cells en masse ?

**A:** Yes, in Jupyter Notebooks, Python cells can be evaluated either individually or en masse, depending on how you choose to execute them. Here's how the evaluation works:

1. **Individual Cell Execution**:
   - You can run a single cell at a time by selecting the cell and pressing `Shift + Enter` (or `Ctrl + Enter` to execute without moving to the next cell).
   - This evaluates only the code within the selected cell, and the output will appear just below it.
   - The state of variables or objects created in this cell is preserved in memory and can be accessed in subsequent cells.

2. **Running Multiple Cells at Once**:
   - **Run All Cells**: You can run all cells in the notebook sequentially by selecting `Run > Run All` from the menu or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + F9`. This will execute each cell in the order they appear.
   - **Run Cells Above**: This option allows you to execute all cells that precede the currently selected cell.
   - **Run Cells Below**: Similarly, this option will run all cells below the selected cell, enabling a segmented run of code blocks.

3. **Execution Order**:
   - Jupyter Notebooks execute cells sequentially, and the order matters. If you run a later cell before running earlier ones that define variables or functions, you may encounter errors.
   - Each cell execution maintains the state of the notebook, meaning the notebook keeps track of variables, imports, and outputs, so you can reference them across different cells.

4. **Kernel Restarts**:
   - Restarting the kernel clears the notebook’s state, removing all variables and definitions from memory. After a restart, you must re-execute the necessary cells to restore the environment.

5. **Cell Dependencies**:
   - Because of this state preservation across cells, cells can be dependent on each other. To ensure consistency, running cells in order ensures that the notebook’s execution flows logically without missing steps or breaking code dependencies.

This flexible approach allows you to evaluate sections of code or the entire notebook, depending on your workflow.

**Q:** Can separate labs and notebooks be linked ?

**A:** Yes, separate Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Labs can be linked or integrated in several ways, depending on your use case. Below are some methods to achieve this:

### 1. **Importing Functions and Variables from Other Notebooks**
   - You can import variables, functions, or classes defined in one notebook into another by treating the other notebook as a module. For this, the `nbformat` package can be used in conjunction with Python's import mechanism.

   Steps:
   - Install the `nbformat` package:  
     ```bash
     pip install nbformat
     ```
   - Use a utility function to import another notebook like this:
     ```python
     import nbformat
     from nbconvert import PythonExporter

     def import_notebook(filename):
         with open(filename) as f:
             notebook = nbformat.read(f, as_version=4)
         exporter = PythonExporter()
         source_code, _ = exporter.from_notebook_node(notebook)
         exec(source_code, globals())
     ```

   - This code reads and executes another Jupyter Notebook, allowing its contents to be available in the current notebook. For example, you can link `notebook_a.ipynb` with `notebook_b.ipynb`.

### 2. **Using Python Modules Across Notebooks**
   - You can also convert notebooks into Python modules and import them directly into other notebooks. To do this:
     - Save the notebook as a `.py` script by selecting `File > Download as > Python (.py)`.
     - Once saved as a Python file, you can import it like any other Python module:
       ```python
       from notebook_a import function_name
       ```

   This way, you can call functions and use variables from the notebook that has been converted into a Python module.

### 3. **IPython’s `run` Command**
   - You can run another notebook within a Jupyter Notebook using IPython’s `%run` magic command.
     ```python
     %run notebook_a.ipynb
     ```
   - This command executes all the cells in the specified notebook, effectively linking the two notebooks together.

### 4. **JupyterLab Linking and Multi-document Interface**
   - **JupyterLab**, the next-generation UI for Jupyter, supports linking and organizing multiple notebooks and documents in one workspace. You can open multiple notebooks in the same interface and even split them into panels.
   - While JupyterLab doesn’t inherently “link” the contents of notebooks, it allows you to work on multiple related notebooks at once, making it easy to cross-reference or copy-paste code between them.

### 5. **Notebook References via REST APIs**
   - If you're working with a JupyterHub or Jupyter Enterprise Gateway setup, you can communicate between separate notebooks running on different kernels or environments via APIs.
   - You can use HTTP requests (e.g., with Python’s `requests` library) to send data between notebooks hosted on a server.

     Example:
     ```python
     import requests
     response = requests.get("http://<notebook-server>/api/path/to/other_notebook")
     print(response.json())
     ```

   This approach is useful for large-scale projects where notebooks need to interact across servers or environments.

### 6. **Using a Shared File System**
   - Another common way to link notebooks is by sharing data files. One notebook can write outputs (e.g., as CSV, JSON, or even as Python pickle objects), and another notebook can read those files.
   - This indirect linking allows one notebook to generate data for another.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Notebook A: Writing to a file
   data.to_csv('output_data.csv')

   # Notebook B: Reading the file
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv('output_data.csv')
   ```

### 7. **Jupyter Widgets and Inter-notebook Communication**
   - If you're using JupyterLab and working with Jupyter Widgets (e.g., `ipywidgets`), you can set up interactive elements in one notebook that trigger actions or updates in another. This can be done by sharing a common state (such as a file or an API), though it requires careful synchronization.

### 8. **Using Dask or Papermill**
   - **Dask** or **Papermill** can be used for managing and linking multiple notebooks that perform data-parallel computations. Dask helps in parallel processing and orchestrating large workloads across notebooks, while Papermill allows you to parameterize and execute notebooks programmatically.
   - With Papermill, you can pass parameters from one notebook to another and link them in a pipeline.

### Conclusion
These methods allow you to link separate Jupyter notebooks or labs:
- For direct imports, using `nbformat`, `%run`, or converting to Python modules works well.
- For larger or distributed systems, API-based communication or shared file systems can provide more modular solutions.
