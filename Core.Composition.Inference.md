**Q: How do scientists surmise constituents of the Earth's core?**

**A:** Scientists infer the core’s makeup by combining five independent constraints: global seismology, gravity/moment-of-inertia, high-pressure mineral physics and ab-initio calculations, cosmochemistry/geochemistry, and geomagnetism/energetics. Together they indicate a liquid outer core and solid inner core of Fe–Ni alloy with several wt% “light elements” (Si, O, S, C, H). ([CaltechAUTHORS][1], [PMC][2], [Scribd][3])

**1) Seismology (primary constraint).**
P- and S-wave observations map the core: S waves vanish in the outer core (liquid), and reflected/converted phases plus normal modes fix sizes and density structure. Results: outer-core radius ≈3,480 km (CMB depth ≈2,890 km) and inner-core radius ≈1,220–1,221 km; density jump at the inner-core boundary ≈0.5–0.6 g cm⁻³. ([PMC][2], [Scribd][3], [eoas.ubc.ca][4])

**2) Gravity and moment of inertia (bulk constraints).**
Any acceptable radial density/composition must match Earth’s total mass and normalized moment-of-inertia; PREM explicitly inverts normal modes, travel times, Q, mass, and MoI to get density vs. depth used in core models. ([CaltechAUTHORS][1])

**3) Mineral physics at core P–T (equations of state, melting, sound speeds).**
Diamond-anvil/shock experiments and DFT give Fe/Fe-alloy melting near the inner-core boundary and the density/sound-speed of likely alloys. Typical ICB temperature estimates: \~5,950 ± 400 K to \~6,230 ± 500 K; these and measured velocities show pure Fe is too dense, implying a light-element “density deficit.” ([AGU Publications][5], [IGPP Web][6])

**4) Cosmochemistry and metal–silicate partitioning (what elements are available and where they go).**
Chondritic abundances for building blocks plus mantle inventories and partitioning during core formation imply Ni ≈5 wt% in the core and constrain plausible light elements to Si, O, S, C, H. ([Department of Geology][7], [PMC][8], [AGU Publications][9])

**5) Geodynamo and transport (state must conduct and convect).**
A sustained magnetic field requires an electrically conductive, convecting liquid core; first-principles calculations show high electrical/thermal conductivities for liquid Fe-alloys, which feed thermal/compositional convection models and power budgets for the dynamo. ([UCL Homepages][10], [White Rose Research Online][11])

**What this synthesis implies (with numbers).**
* **Pressures:** \~136 GPa (CMB) to \~364 GPa (center). **Mass/volume:** core ≈32 wt% of Earth, ≈16 vol%. **Radii:** outer core ≈3,480 km; inner core ≈1,220–1,221 km. ([PMC][2])
* **Density deficits relative to pure Fe:** outer core ≈5–10%; inner core ≈≈3–4% near the ICB. ([PMC][12], [AGU Publications][13])
* **Likely compositions (illustrative ranges, weight %):**
– **Outer core:** Fe + \~5 Ni + \~1.7 S + 0–4.0 Si + 0.8–5.3 O + \~0.2 C + 0–0.26 H.
– **Inner core:** Fe + \~5 Ni + 0–1.1 S + 0–2.3 Si + 0–0.1 O + 0–1.3 C + 0–0.23 H.
These satisfy seismology + mineral-physics + geochemical bounds but remain non-unique.&#x20;
