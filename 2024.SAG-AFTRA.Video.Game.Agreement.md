**Q:** Explain the agreement SAG-AFTRA has reached with individual video games.

**A:** SAG-AFTRA recently reached interim agreements with 80 individual video games, primarily from indie and smaller studios, during their ongoing strike against major game companies. These agreements center on crucial protections related to artificial intelligence (AI) usage, safeguarding voice actors from AI exploitation and ensuring their labor rights. Additionally, the agreements include provisions for fair compensation and performance conditions. These studios have agreed to abide by these terms, demonstrating their feasibility and importance to maintaining industry standards. However, major publishers like EA and Warner Bros. remain outside this agreement.
