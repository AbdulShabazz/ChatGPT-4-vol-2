---

## **2. Out-of-Pocket Expenses Before Bank Approval:**

Before the bank grants final approval and disburses funds, you'll likely incur **several upfront, out-of-pocket expenses**:

### **a. Land Deposit (Earnest Money):**

* Typically **5–10% of land price** *(refundable or non-refundable based on sales contract terms)*.
* **Example:** \$100,000 lot → Approximately **\$5,000–\$10,000 deposit** upfront.

### **b. Architectural and Preliminary Design Fees:**

* Banks require preliminary architectural drawings or building plans before loan approval.
* Cost: Typically **\$2,500–\$10,000+** depending on complexity.
* **Note:** Most banks require you to initially pay for this yourself; you can later reimburse from the loan.

### **c. Engineering and Site Analysis (due diligence):**

* Topographic surveys, soil tests, geotechnical reports, environmental studies.
* Typical Costs:

  * Topographic Survey: **\$1,000–\$3,000**
  * Soil/Geotechnical Testing: **\$1,500–\$5,000**
  * Site feasibility/environmental review (if necessary): **\$1,000–\$3,000**

### **d. Permit Application Fees and Zoning Approvals:**

* Local building permits, zoning variance applications, inspection fees.
* Typical Costs: **\$500–\$2,500+** depending on jurisdiction.

### **e. Appraisal and Bank Application Fees:**

* A lender-ordered appraisal of your construction project and land valuation is mandatory.
* Typical Costs: **\$500–\$1,500** (varies by lender and property complexity).
* Loan application/origination fee (if applicable): usually around **0.5%–1% of loan amount** (sometimes collected at closing, but possibly upfront).

### **f. Title Search and Title Insurance:**

* Title company verifies clear title and provides lender-required title insurance.
* Typical Costs: **\$500–\$1,500+**

### **g. Legal Fees (if applicable):**

* Contract reviews, title searches, and other legal verifications.
* Typical Costs: **\$500–\$2,500+** (highly variable depending on complexity)

---

## **Typical Summary of Out-of-Pocket Expenses (Before Loan Approval)**

| Expense Category                          | Typical Cost Range     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Land Earnest Deposit (Down Payment)**   | **\$5,000–\$20,000+**  |

| **Total Estimated Out-of-Pocket**         | **\$12,000–\$45,000+** |

---

## **3. After Loan Approval (Reimbursement Possibilities):**

* Many lenders allow you to reimburse yourself for certain upfront expenses such as architectural and engineering fees, once loan approval and disbursements begin.
* Ensure you document all pre-paid expenses with detailed receipts and invoices, as reimbursement is typically contingent on adequate proof.

---

## **4. Typical Construction-to-Permanent Loan Structure (For Reference):**

* **Land Acquisition Phase:**
  Funds released at closing for land purchase, less any required equity/down payment.

* **Construction Phase:**
  Disbursed incrementally in stages as construction progresses (draw schedule).

* **Permanent Mortgage Phase:**
  Automatically converts to permanent mortgage upon completion and final appraisal, typically with a fixed or adjustable long-term interest rate.

---

## **5. Recommendations for Budgeting and Financial Preparation:**

* **Set aside at least 3%–5% of the total project budget** specifically for upfront, pre-loan expenses.
* Include contingency funds of at least **5%–10% of the total project cost** to handle unexpected or additional costs encountered during initial planning.

---

## **Conclusion & Key Recommendations:**

* **Construction-to-permanent loans** typically **do** cover the major components of a residential project but not all initial due diligence and setup costs.
* Expect and prepare for **approximately \$12,000–\$45,000 (or roughly 3%–5%+ of total project budget)** out-of-pocket before loan approval.
* Clearly discuss with lenders what expenses are reimbursable upon loan approval and disbursement.

**Q: Ah! So what I need is a general contractor (GC)! Can they also recommend and or choose the architect and engineering firm, or do I have the selection process backwards?**

**A:** Your insight is correct—your instinct to hire a **General Contractor (GC)** first to handle architect and engineering firm selection is understandable, but in most cases, you should actually approach the process **in reverse order**.

In residential construction, particularly custom homes, **the recommended and conventional workflow** is to first contract with an **Architect** (and potentially a design-oriented project manager or architectural firm), who subsequently helps you select and engage specialized engineers, and finally, assist you in hiring or recommending a suitable General Contractor. Here’s a detailed clarification on the optimal order of selection and engagement:

---

## **1. Recommended Professional Selection Order:**

The optimal sequence is typically:

1. **Architect / Architectural Firm (First Step)**

   * Initial concept design.
   * Feasibility analysis, preliminary sketches, detailed construction plans.
   * Helps select specialized engineers (structural, civil, MEP) as needed.

2. **Specialized Engineering Firms (Second Step)**

   * Engaged under the supervision of the architect to provide structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil site solutions.
   * Coordinated by architect, ensuring cohesive integration into the final plans.

3. **General Contractor (Final Step)**

   * Brought in after detailed plans and specifications are finalized or nearing completion.
   * Provides accurate construction estimates/bids based on detailed architectural/engineering plans.
   * Responsible for executing construction based on comprehensive documentation.

---

## **2. Why Architect Before General Contractor?**

* **Design and Cost Control:**

  * Architects clarify design and scope upfront, enabling accurate and competitive GC bids.
  * Reduces changes, cost overruns, and conflicts due to unclear scope or incomplete information.

* **Alignment of Priorities:**

  * Architects advocate directly for your design goals, aesthetic preferences, and functional requirements before construction begins.
  * Contractors focus primarily on construction efficiency and cost-effectiveness, rather than design detail and customization nuances.

* **Competitive Bidding Advantage:**

  * Having completed architectural and engineering documents first allows you to solicit competitive bids from several General Contractors.
  * Provides leverage in price negotiations and contractor selection.

---

## **3. Can a General Contractor (GC) Recommend Architects or Engineers?**

**Yes**, a reputable and established General Contractor can indeed recommend architects and engineers, especially if you already have a strong, trusted relationship with one. However, there are some considerations:

### **Advantages:**

* Established working relationships between GC, architect, and engineer can facilitate smoother project coordination.
* Potentially quicker project mobilization and streamlined communication.

### **Disadvantages:**

* Possible bias or conflict of interest if the GC exclusively refers professionals from whom they routinely benefit.
* Limited competitive pricing or design alternatives if you rely entirely on the GC’s network.

---

## **4. Conventional Best Practice Workflow (Detailed):**

* **Step A:** **You select and contract an Architect/Architectural Firm**

  * Define design vision, scope, goals.
  * Architect guides initial regulatory feasibility studies, zoning analysis, preliminary budgetary constraints.

* **Step B:** **Architect helps select appropriate Specialized Engineers**

  * Architect recommends structural, civil, mechanical, electrical, plumbing engineers as necessary for project complexity.
  * Ensures all designs are coordinated efficiently.

* **Step C:** **Completion of Architectural and Engineering Plans**

  * Detailed construction documentation (BIM plans, schedules, specifications).
  * Fully-defined, compliant designs for permitting and GC bidding.

* **Step D:** **Competitive General Contractor Selection**

  * Detailed architectural/engineering package shared with multiple GCs.
  * GCs prepare detailed bids and construction schedules.
  * You (with architect consultation) select the most suitable GC.

---

## **5. Recommendations for Optimal Outcomes:**

* **Hire the Architect First:**
  Enables thorough planning and design that precisely fits your vision and budget.

* **Use GC Recommendations Strategically (if desired):**
  While architects typically recommend GCs, you can still leverage relationships or suggestions from reputable GCs for initial consultations, then independently choose an architect to manage the design process.

* **Clearly Defined Contracts:**
  Ensure roles and responsibilities between architects, engineers, and the GC are explicitly stated and contractually documented.

## **6. Example Financial and Project Efficiency Scenario:**

| Approach                           | Project Efficiency                                          | Potential Cost Efficiency                                                                   | Design & Quality Alignment                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architect → GC** *(Recommended)* | High (Clear plans, competitive bids)                        | High (GCs compete based on complete docs)                                                   | High (Directly matches client’s vision)             |
| **GC → Architect**                 | Moderate (GC leads, potentially limited design flexibility) | Moderate-Low (Less price competition, potential cost inflation due to design modifications) | Moderate-Low (Potentially compromised design goals) |

---

## **7. Typical Industry Recommendation (Summary)**

* **Primary Approach:**
  **Hire architect first**, finalize construction plans, then competitively hire the General Contractor.

* **Alternative Approach:**
  Hire a **design-build firm**, which integrates architecture, engineering, and construction under a single unified team—simplifying workflow but potentially limiting competitive pricing and design flexibility.

---

## **Conclusion (Clear Recommendation):**

Your initial instinct to have a GC handle the architect and engineering team is understandable but **less conventional** for custom residential construction. **Hiring an Architect first, then engineers, and finally selecting the General Contractor based on detailed finalized plans** is industry-standard practice for achieving maximum project efficiency, optimal cost control, design quality, and minimizing risk.
