**Q:** How do you delete a wire in Unreal Engine Blueprints ?

**A:** Deleting a wire (i.e., a connection) between nodes in Unreal Engine Blueprints is a common task when organizing or refactoring your Blueprint scripts. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to remove a wire:

### **Method 1: Using the Mouse**

1. **Open Your Blueprint:**
   - Double-click the Blueprint you want to edit in the Content Browser to open it in the Blueprint Editor.

2. **Locate the Connection:**
   - Find the two nodes connected by the wire you wish to delete.

3. **Select the Wire:**
   - Hover your mouse over the wire. It should highlight when you hover over it.
   - **Click** directly on the wire to select it. The wire might change color to indicate it's selected.

4. **Delete the Wire:**
   - Press the **`Delete`** key on your keyboard.
   - **OR**
   - **Right-click** on the selected wire and choose **`Delete`** or **`Break Link`** from the context menu.

### **Method 2: Disconnecting via the Pin**

1. **Identify the Pin:**
   - Locate one end of the wire you want to remove. This will be connected to a specific pin on a node (input or output).

2. **Right-Click the Pin:**
   - Right-click directly on the pin where the wire is connected.

3. **Disconnect:**
   - From the context menu, select **`Disconnect`**. This will remove the wire connected to that pin.

### **Method 3: Dragging to Disconnect**

1. **Click and Drag:**
   - Click on the wire you want to delete and **drag** it away from the pin it's connected to.

2. **Release to Disconnect:**
   - Release the mouse button once the wire is detached from the pin. This action will disconnect the wire.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Undo if Needed:** If you accidentally delete the wrong wire, you can quickly undo the action by pressing **`Ctrl + Z`** (Windows) or **`Cmd + Z`** (Mac).

- **Organize Your Wires:** Keeping your Blueprint wires organized can make it easier to manage connections. Consider using reroute nodes to tidy up complex wire layouts.

- **Break All Links:** If you want to remove all connections from a specific pin, right-click the pin and choose **`Break All Links`** from the context menu.
