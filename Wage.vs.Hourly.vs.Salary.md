**Q:** Explain the difference between wage, hourly wage, and salary.

**A:** The terms **wage**, **hourly wage**, and **salary** are often used in the context of employee compensation, but they refer to different methods of payment for work. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each:

1. **Wage:**
   - A broad term referring to monetary compensation paid by an employer to an employee for work done.
   - Wages can be calculated in various ways, including **hourly wages** or **piece-rate wages** (payment based on units of work completed).
   - Wages typically fluctuate based on the number of hours worked or output produced.
   
2. **Hourly Wage:**
   - A specific type of wage where the employee is paid a set amount for each hour of work.
   - Example: If an employee earns $20 per hour and works 40 hours in a week, they will be paid $800 for that week.
   - Workers with hourly wages are often eligible for **overtime pay**, where they receive a higher hourly rate (usually 1.5 times the regular rate) for hours worked beyond 40 per week.
   - Pay varies each pay period depending on the number of hours worked.
   
3. **Salary:**
   - A fixed amount of compensation paid regularly (usually monthly or biweekly), regardless of the number of hours worked.
   - Salaried employees typically receive the same paycheck amount regardless of how many hours they work in a week, even if they work more than 40 hours.
   - **Exempt employees** (most salaried employees) are often not entitled to overtime pay.
   - Salaries are typically expressed as an annual amount, e.g., $60,000 per year, but payments are distributed throughout the year.

### Key Differences:
- **Consistency of Pay:**
   - **Hourly Wage**: Pay varies based on hours worked.
   - **Salary**: Pay remains consistent regardless of hours worked.
   
- **Overtime Eligibility:**
   - **Hourly Wage**: Generally eligible for overtime.
   - **Salary**: Typically not eligible for overtime, unless classified as non-exempt.

- **Pay Structure:**
   - **Hourly Wage**: Paid by the hour.
   - **Salary**: Paid as a set amount over a longer period, commonly yearly.
