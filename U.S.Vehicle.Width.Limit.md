**Q: Is there a U.S. legal limit to the width of a road vehicle?**

**A:** Yes. In the United States, there is a **federal legal limit** on the width of most road vehicles.

### Federal Standard

* **Maximum width:** **102 inches (8 feet 6 inches)**, not including mirrors or certain safety devices.
* **Authority:** Established under the **Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) of 1982** and codified at **23 CFR 658.16** and **49 USC § 31111**.
* **Application:** This limit applies to vehicles traveling on the **National Network** (the Interstate Highway System and other designated primary routes).

### State Variations

* States generally adopt the federal **102-inch** standard for major highways.
* On **local roads** or in older areas with narrow lanes/bridges, some states enforce a smaller limit of **96 inches (8 feet)**.
* **Special permits** can be issued for oversize vehicles (e.g., construction equipment, wide-load trailers, manufactured homes).

### Exceptions

* Certain **farm equipment, fire trucks, or RVs** may be granted exemptions depending on state law.
* **Side-view mirrors, lights, and safety devices** do not count toward the width measurement.

### Summary

* **Normal legal vehicle width in the U.S.:** **102 inches (8'6")** on federal highways.
* **Older/local roads may restrict to:** **96 inches (8')**.
* **Oversize permits** required for wider vehicles.

Would you like me to also provide the **legal height and length limits** for U.S. road vehicles for a full picture of federal dimensional standards?

**Q: Is there a limit on length, height? Payload width, height?**

**A:** Yes — U.S. federal law also sets limits on **vehicle length, height, and (by extension) payload dimensions** for vehicles traveling on the National Network (Interstates and designated highways). These are spelled out in **23 CFR Part 658** and **49 USC §31111–31114**.

---

## **Height**

* **Federal maximum height:** **13 feet 6 inches (162 inches)**.
* **Note:** The federal government does not explicitly regulate height — it is generally left to the states. However, 13’6” is the de facto national limit because most states adopt it (a few western states allow up to **14 feet**).
* **Payload effect:** Your payload cannot extend above this vehicle height limit unless a state oversize permit is issued.

---

## **Width**

* As covered earlier: **102 inches (8’6”)**, excluding mirrors/safety devices.
* **Payload effect:** The payload itself counts toward this width. If your cargo makes the vehicle wider than 102 inches, you must obtain an oversize permit.

---

## **Length**

Federal law distinguishes between **single vehicles** and **combinations**:

* **Single vehicles (straight trucks):**

  * Federal minimum allowance: **at least 40 feet** (states may allow more).
  * Some states allow **45 feet** or longer for buses and motorcoaches.

* **Combination vehicles (tractor + semitrailer):**

  * **Semitrailer length limit:** **53 feet** (federally guaranteed on the National Network).
  * **No federal overall length limit** on tractor–semitrailer combinations, as long as the trailer is within the 53-foot allowance.
  * **Double trailers (twin 28s):** Each trailer may be **28 feet 6 inches** long.

* **Payload effect:** The length of the cargo counts toward trailer length. Overhanging cargo beyond the legal trailer length generally requires **overlength permits**.

---

## **Weight (related to payload)**

* Though you asked about dimensions, note that federal law also restricts **weight**:

  * **80,000 pounds gross vehicle weight** on Interstate highways (without permit).
  * Up to **20,000 pounds per single axle**, **34,000 pounds per tandem axle** (per the Federal Bridge Formula).
* These weight restrictions are usually the limiting factor for payload, even before dimensional limits.

---

## **Oversize and Overweight Permits**

* **State-issued permits** allow movement of vehicles/cargoes exceeding width, height, or length restrictions (e.g., construction machinery, manufactured housing, wind turbine blades).
* Typically requires **escort vehicles, special signage, or restricted travel hours**.

| Height                     | 13’6” (most states) – 14’ (some western states) | Above this requires permit                      |
| Single Vehicle Length      | 40–45 ft                                        | States may allow longer                         |
| Semitrailer Length         | 53 ft                                           | Guaranteed on National Network                  |
| Double Trailers            | 28’6” each                                      | “Twin 28s” standard                             |
| Overall Combination Length | No federal limit                                | Tractor + trailer(s), limited by trailer length |
| Gross Weight               | 80,000 lbs                                      | Bridge Formula applies                          |

Would you like me to prepare a **breakdown by vehicle type** (passenger cars, buses, RVs, commercial trucks, specialized loads) so you can see exactly how these limits differ in practice?
