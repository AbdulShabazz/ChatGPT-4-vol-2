**Q: Can you buy (Tesla) FSD as an aftermarket addon?**

**A:** Certainly. Here's a detailed, citation‑supported explanation regarding whether Tesla's Full Self‑Driving (FSD) can be purchased as an aftermarket add‑on:

## Can You Buy Tesla FSD After Delivery ("Aftermarket Add-On")?

### 1. **Yes — We’re in the software-enabled era**

* **In‑App Purchase After Delivery**
  Tesla allows owners to purchase the FSD package at any time *after* delivery via the Tesla mobile app or account portal. The vehicle simply needs to receive the required software update first.
  ([Tesla][1], [Tesla Motors Club][2])

* **Historical Evidence**
  Forum posts as far back as 2018 show owners seeing the option to buy FSD three weeks post-delivery.
  ([Tesla Owners Online][3])

* **Community Confirmation**
  A Tesla Motors Club thread notes that current vehicles “are equipped for FSD in its current iteration,” and that the software can be purchased post‑delivery via credit card in the app.

### 2. **Cost Options: One-Time Purchase or Subscription**

* **One‑Time Purchase Fee**
  As of **September 2023**, FSD could be added for **\$12,000 USD** one‑time (or CAD \$15,000).
  ([TESLARATI][4], [MYEV Trips][5])
  In **April 2024**, Tesla reduced that price in the U.S. to **\$8,000**, and dropped the monthly subscription price to **\$99/month** (down from \$199).
  ([TESLARATI][4])

* **Subscription Option**
  Owners may also opt for a **monthly subscription**, typically \$99/month (current rate if you already had Enhanced Autopilot) or otherwise \$99/month for new users (as of April 2024).

### 3. **Hardware Compatibility & Upgrades**

* **Vehicles Must Be FSD‑Capable**
  Most Teslas built today are “FSD‑ready” in hardware, and software enables the functionality.
  ([MYEV Trips][5], [The Verge][7])

* **However… HW3 May Require Upgrade**
  Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, acknowledged that vehicles equipped with **Hardware 3 (HW3)** may need additional hardware upgrades to support the latest FSD software—namely, the newer **Hardware 4 (HW4)**. The upgrade process is “absolutely painful and difficult,” and only owners who previously purchased FSD are eligible for such upgrades (free by policy).
  ([The Verge][7])

### 4. **Community Insights & User Experiences**

* **Subscription Trials**
  Reddit users have noted that FSD can be added for a monthly subscription—some even tried it for a month to evaluate whether to continue.
  ([Reddit][8])

* **App Availability Issues**
  Some users have reported delays or greyed-out toggles in their app when trying to activate FSD immediately after delivery, suggesting there might be a waiting period until the first update.

## Summary Table (Aftermarket FSD Options)

| Option                     | Available After Delivery? | Details                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One-time purchase**      | Yes                       | \~\$8,000 USD (U.S., as of April 2024) for lifetime access            |
| **Monthly subscription**   | Yes                       | \~\$99/month (U.S.)                                                   |
| **Hardware requirement**   | Maybe                     | HW3 vehicles may require upgrade to HW4 to access latest FSD releases |

### Final Word

Yes—you **can** buy Tesla’s Full Self-Driving package as an aftermarket add-on. You have the flexibility to add it at any time after delivery, either via a one-time payment (currently \$8,000 in the U.S.) or a monthly subscription (\~\$99/month). However, be aware of potential hardware limitations: if your vehicle uses HW3, an upgrade to HW4 may be required to access the newest FSD features. Activation generally happens through the Tesla app but may sometimes be delayed until after certain updates.
