### Practical takeaway

* If you are an adult developer or studio: you primarily target GGJ; you can still engage with GGJ Next as a mentor, educator, or host if you work with youth.
* If you are organizing for middle/high-school students: GGJ Next is the intended program, with curricular support and a direct pipeline into the G4C Student Challenge.
* Structurally: think of GGJ as the flagship global jam, and GGJ Next as its youth/education track that runs on a longer timeline and leans into social-impact themes.
