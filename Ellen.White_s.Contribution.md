**Q: What do Seventh Day Adventist believe was Ellen White's contribution?**

**A:** Seventh-day Adventists generally believe that Ellen White’s main contribution was a prophetic, guiding ministry to their movement, not a new source of doctrine on the level of the Bible.

More specifically, standard Adventist teaching holds that:

* She exercised the New Testament “gift of prophecy” and was “the Lord’s messenger,” whose visions and counsels helped shape and correct the early church. ([1][1])

* Her writings are seen as:

  * A manifestation of the gift of prophecy.
  * Providing “comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction” to the church. ([2][2])
  * An “inspired guide” to understanding and applying Scripture, but not exhausting its meaning. ([3][3])

* They officially teach that:

  * The 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are the only canon and final authority for doctrine and practice.
  * Her writings are not a new canon, not the basis for doctrines, and must themselves be tested by the Bible. ([4][4])

* In terms of content, Adventists see her contribution in:

  * Confirming and encouraging distinctive beliefs (e.g., Sabbath, Second Coming, sanctuary, “remnant” identity).
  * Strong emphasis on Christ-centered piety (books like *Steps to Christ*), education, health reform, and mission. ([5][5])

So, in Adventist self-understanding, Ellen White’s contribution is a continuing prophetic ministry that helps interpret and apply the Bible for their community, while the Bible alone remains the church’s doctrinal foundation.
