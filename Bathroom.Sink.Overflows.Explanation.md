**Q: Why are residential bathroom purpose sinks manufactured without overflows? Or has a contractor misappropriated a sink for  bathroom use?**

**A:** Short answer: Many residential bathroom lavatories are intentionally manufactured without overflows. That is code-compliant when the fixture is listed to the applicable standards and paired with the correct “no-overflow” drain. It is not automatically a contractor error. \[IAPMO Code Spotlight — forms.iapmo.org/email\_marketing/codespotlight/2018/mar8.htm] ([forms.iapmo.org][1])

Why manufacturers omit the overflow

* Not required by model standards for lavatories and sinks; overflows are optional “at the option of the manufacturer.” \[CSA Notice on ASME A112.19.2/CSA B45.1 — [www.csagroup.org/wp-content/uploads/PlumbingProducts308.pdf](http://www.csagroup.org/wp-content/uploads/PlumbingProducts308.pdf)] ([CSA Group][2])
* Many vessel-style lavs are designed without overflows; you must use a compatible drain. \[Ruvati explainer — [www.ruvati.com/what-is-a-vessel-sink/](http://www.ruvati.com/what-is-a-vessel-sink/)] ([Ruvati USA][3])
* Overflow passages collect slime and debris; omitting them avoids that maintenance point. \[The Spruce overview — [www.thespruce.com/the-purpose-of-a-sink-overflow-2718785](http://www.thespruce.com/the-purpose-of-a-sink-overflow-2718785)] ([The Spruce][4])
* Overflows can improve drain performance by admitting air, but they are not mandatory in lavs. \[Signature Hardware guide — [www.signaturehardware.com/ideas-buying-guide-sink-and-tub-overflow-drain.html](http://www.signaturehardware.com/ideas-buying-guide-sink-and-tub-overflow-drain.html)] ([Signature Hardware][5])

When a no-overflow lav is acceptable

* The lavatory is listed to ASME A112.19.2/CSA B45.1 (typical marking under the bowl) and installed per instructions. \[NY State Plumbing Code §419.1 references these standards — dos.ny.gov/2020-plumbing-code-new-york-state] ([Department of State][6])
* A matching non-overflow drain is used (often a non-closing “grid” type). Examples: Oatey Designline grid drain “without overflow”; 1.5-in non-overflow grid drains. \[Home Depot product page — [www.homedepot.com/p/Oatey-Designline-Chrome-Plated-Brass-Grid-Drain-without-Overflow-HDC9691/315724196](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Oatey-Designline-Chrome-Plated-Brass-Grid-Drain-without-Overflow-HDC9691/315724196)] ([The Home Depot][7]) \[Premier Copper example — [www.amazon.com/dp/B002DM61MO](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DM61MO)] ([Amazon][8])
* If an overflow exists, code requires it be piped on the fixture side of the trap. \[NYC Plumbing Code §405.7.1 — codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCadmin/0-0-0-161551] ([American Legal Publishing][9])

When it may be a misapplication

* A closing pop-up drain is installed on a no-overflow lav. That increases flood risk and often violates manufacturer instructions; use a non-closing drain for no-overflow bowls. \[Zeek Living drain selection note — [www.zeekliving.com/blogs/zeeksblog/pop-up-drains-with-overflow-vs-no-overflow](http://www.zeekliving.com/blogs/zeeksblog/pop-up-drains-with-overflow-vs-no-overflow)] ([ZEEK][10])
* Local amendments explicitly require overflows or specific listings. Always check your jurisdiction. The model standards make overflows optional, but authorities can amend. \[CSA Notice language on overflows being optional and code caveats — [www.csagroup.org/wp-content/uploads/PlumbingProducts308.pdf](http://www.csagroup.org/wp-content/uploads/PlumbingProducts308.pdf)] ([CSA Group][2]) \[IAPMO Code Spotlight — forms.iapmo.org/email\_marketing/codespotlight/2018/mar8.htm] ([forms.iapmo.org][1])

Key code numbers you can verify

* Lavatory waste outlet: minimum 1-1/4 in (32 mm). \[IPC 2018 §419.3 — codes.iccsafe.org/s/IPC2018P5/chapter-4-fixtures-faucets-and-fixture-fittings/IPC2018P5-Ch04-Sec419.3] ([ICC Digital Codes][11])
* Trap sizing rule of thumb aligns with that outlet size for lavs. \[IPC 2018 §709/§1002; example jurisdictional codification — codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCadmin/0-0-0-162726] ([American Legal Publishing][12])

Bottom line

* Bathroom lavs without overflows are common and permissible if the fixture is listed and the correct non-overflow drain is used. That is not automatically a sign of the wrong sink. \[IAPMO Code Spotlight — forms.iapmo.org/email\_marketing/codespotlight/2018/mar8.htm] ([forms.iapmo.org][1])
* To confirm on your install: look for the ASME/CSA listing on the bowl, and check that the drain assembly is explicitly “for sinks without overflow.” \[NY State Plumbing Code §419.1; Oatey product page — dos.ny.gov/2020-plumbing-code-new-york-state ; [www.homedepot.com/p/Oatey-Designline-Chrome-Plated-Brass-Grid-Drain-without-Overflow-HDC9691/315724196](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Oatey-Designline-Chrome-Plated-Brass-Grid-Drain-without-Overflow-HDC9691/315724196)] ([Department of State][6], [The Home Depot][7])
