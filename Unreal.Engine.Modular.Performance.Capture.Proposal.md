# Proposal for Modular Performance Capture and Animation Workflow in Unreal Engine

## Introduction

This proposal outlines a novel modular approach to character animation using performance capture within Unreal Engine. The workflow focuses on capturing individual joint motions as splines, constrained by anatomical limits, and dynamically blending them to create unique character movements. By using this modular framework, character animation becomes more scalable, adaptable, and efficient, especially in the context of human motion.

## Problem Statement

Traditional motion capture methods rely on predefined **full-body animations**, which often have **rigid use cases** and do not account for individual variations or dynamic adjustments needed in real-time. Current solutions lack flexibility in modifying or blending animations on a per-joint basis while maintaining anatomically correct movement. Furthermore, existing workflows may not allow for custom-tailored movement ranges for specific characters or dynamic adaptation based on input or environmental conditions.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a **modular performance capture workflow** that focuses on capturing and blending movements at each joint or bend point, constrained to realistic ranges of motion. This approach enables the creation of customized movesets for characters by using **spline-based movement capture** and **dynamic blending algorithms**.

### Key Components

1. **Human Skeleton & Bend Points:**
   - Map key bend points (e.g., elbows, knees, wrists) to a skeletal system in Unreal Engine.
   - Define rotational limits (range of motion) for each joint, ensuring anatomically correct movement.

2. **Custom Movement Splines:**
   - Capture motion data for each joint using custom splines, which represent the movement path within the joint's defined range.
   - These splines allow fine-tuning of the movement's speed, acceleration, and trajectory.

3. **Blending Algorithms:**
   - Implement blending algorithms (e.g., Linear Interpolation, Cubic Splines) to dynamically transition between different motion splines.
   - These algorithms enable the system to adapt fluidly to varying character movements or external inputs.

4. **Constraint-Based Motion Capture:**
   - Apply anatomical constraints to the movement splines, ensuring the captured data respects natural human joint limitations.
   - This ensures that no motion exceeds the character’s realistic range of motion, improving the physical fidelity of the animations.

5. **Modular Moveset Construction:**
   - Using the blend of multiple captured movements, reconstruct a full-body animation in real time.
   - Each movement spline can be reused across various characters or scenarios, allowing for a scalable and flexible animation system.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation of this modular animation system in Unreal Engine will proceed through the following steps:

1. **Modular Spline Creation**

For each joint, we will create custom movement splines using Unreal Engine's **SplineComponent** system. These splines will be used to capture movement data from motion capture or animation sequences and stored for future use.

```cpp
USplineComponent* MovementSpline;
MovementSpline = CreateDefaultSubobject<USplineComponent>(TEXT("MovementSpline"));
```
2. **Joint Constraints Definition**

Each bend point will have its range of motion constrained using Unreal Engine’s ConstraintInstance system, ensuring that motion stays within anatomically realistic limits.
```cpp
FConstraintInstance ElbowConstraint;
ElbowConstraint.AngularSwing1Limit = EAngularConstraintMotion::ACM_Limited;
ElbowConstraint.AngularTwistLimit = EAngularConstraintMotion::ACM_Limited;
```
3. **Movement Capture & Splines Parameterization**

Once the spline structure is defined, movement capture data will be applied to each spline. The system will parameterize splines by adjusting properties such as:

*	Speed of movement
*	Acceleration/deceleration
* Ease-in and ease-out curves

4. **Animation Blending via Blueprint**

Using Unreal Engine’s Animation Blueprint, we will blend between multiple captured motion splines. The Blend Pose node will be used to manage smooth transitions between splines, forming the final full-body movement sequence.
```
[Input Pose (Idle)]
    -> [Blend Pose 1 (Walk)]
    -> [Blend Pose 2 (Run)]
    -> [Output Pose (Final Blended Move)]
```
5. **Real-Time Adaptation and Application**

The system will dynamically adapt character movesets based on environmental inputs or user interaction. These modular movements can be further optimized for performance, ensuring real-time blending and animation generation.

**Advantages of the Proposed Workflow**

	1.	**Flexibility and Reusability:**
*	Movements captured for each joint are modular, enabling the reuse of specific actions across different characters or scenarios.
*	Custom-tailored movement splines allow for greater creative control and adaptability for each character.
	2.	**Anatomical Accuracy:**
*	The workflow integrates joint constraints to maintain anatomically accurate motion, preventing unrealistic movements during blending.
	3.	**Dynamic Blending:**
*	The use of splines enables fluid blending of motions in real-time, ensuring smooth transitions and responsive character animation under varying conditions.
	4.	**Scalable and Customizable:**
*	The modular nature of the system allows for easy expansion, enabling the creation of large, diverse sets of animations without the need for new full-body captures.

**Future Expansion**

This modular performance capture system can be further expanded to include:

*	Integration with External Motion Capture Systems: Real-time data from external motion capture setups can be imported into the spline system.
*	Procedural Animation Generation: Automated generation of movement splines for non-humanoid characters or procedural environments.
*	AI-Driven Animation Blending: Machine learning models can be incorporated to predict the most natural blending of movements based on gameplay context.

**Conclusion**

The proposed modular animation workflow offers a scalable, flexible, and anatomically accurate solution for character animation in Unreal Engine. By introducing modular spline-based performance capture and blending algorithms, this system allows for greater creative control, reusability, and dynamic real-time adaptation. We believe this approach will significantly enhance the realism and responsiveness of character animations, offering developers powerful tools to create more immersive and lifelike interactive experiences.
