**Q: If there are upstream github commits I want to merge, but the only choice given is to open an upstream pull request or discard my commits, what are my options?**

**A:** If you're working with a forked repository and GitHub only presents you with two options—**"Open a pull request"** to upstream or **"Discard my commits"**—but your goal is to **merge upstream commits into your own fork**, not push your changes upstream or discard them, then GitHub’s web UI is insufficient for this task.

Here are your actual **options from the command line**, which give you full control over merging upstream commits into your forked repository:

---

###  **Option 1: Set Up the `upstream` Remote and Pull Changes**

This is the standard and most reliable method:

1. **Add the upstream remote** (if not already added):

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/REPO_NAME.git
   ```

2. **Fetch the latest upstream changes**:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. **Merge the upstream branch (e.g., `main`) into your local working branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

4. **Resolve any merge conflicts if they appear**, then commit.

5. **Push the updated main branch to your GitHub fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

---

###  **Option 2: Rebase Your Changes on Top of Upstream**

This avoids merge commits and rewrites history:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git rebase upstream/main
git push origin main --force-with-lease  # only if you already pushed before
```

Use rebase only if you're okay rewriting history or working solo.

---

###  **Option 3: Create a New Branch to Test the Merge**

For safety and experimentation:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b merge-test upstream/main
git merge origin/main  # bring in your changes
```

Then test everything locally before doing a full merge or rebase on your `main`.

| Action                     | Description                        | Safe?     | Rewrites History? |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| `git merge upstream/main`  | Normal way to incorporate upstream |  Yes      |  No               |
| `git rebase upstream/main` | Cleaner history, linear            |  Risky    |  Yes              |
| `git cherry-pick <commit>` | Apply individual commits           |  Yes      |  No               |
| GitHub Web UI              | May force PR or discard            |  Limited  |  No               |

###  Why GitHub UI Restricts This

GitHub’s web interface is **oriented toward pull requests and forks**, not maintaining upstream parity. It hides options like merging upstream unless you do it locally.

Let me know if you’d like to script this or automate syncing with upstream periodically.

**Q: What is the difference between a current change and an incoming change, when resolving commits on a merge commit?**

**A:** When resolving merge conflicts during a **merge commit** in Git, the terms **“current change”** and **“incoming change”** refer to the two sides of the merge that are in conflict.

---

###  Definitions

* **Current change**:

  * This is the change **from your branch**, the one **currently checked out** (typically `HEAD`).
  * These are **your local commits** or changes made before initiating the merge.
  * Represented in conflict markers as the **top section** (above `=======`).

* **Incoming change**:

  * This is the change **from the branch you're merging in** (e.g., `main`, `develop`, or `upstream/main`).
  * These are **new commits from the other branch** that Git is trying to integrate into your branch.
  * Represented in conflict markers as the **bottom section** (below `=======`).

---

###  Conflict Marker Example

```diff
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is your current change.
=======
This is the incoming change from the branch being merged.
>>>>>>> upstream/main
```

* `<<<<<<< HEAD` — Your current branch (current change)
* `=======` — Divider between current and incoming
* `>>>>>>> branch-name` — The incoming branch

---

###  Merge Context

Suppose you're merging `upstream/main` into your fork's `main`.

* You’re on `main` (your fork), so:

  * **Current** = your local `main`
  * **Incoming** = `upstream/main`

In another case, if you’re doing:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git merge main
```

Then:

* **Current** = your `feature-branch`
* **Incoming** = `main`

---

###  Resolving the Conflict

You can resolve it by:

* Accepting **only current**
* Accepting **only incoming**
* **Combining both manually**
* Using a **merge tool or Git GUI** to reconcile the difference

For example:

```bash
# Accept current
git checkout --ours conflicted_file.ext

# Accept incoming
git checkout --theirs conflicted_file.ext
```

Then finalize with:

```bash
git add conflicted_file.ext
git commit
```

###  Summary Table

| Term                | Refers to           | Source       | Conflict Marker       |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| **Current Change**  | Your active branch  | `HEAD`       | `<<<<<<< HEAD`        |
| **Incoming Change** | Branch being merged | Merge target | `>>>>>>> branch-name` |
