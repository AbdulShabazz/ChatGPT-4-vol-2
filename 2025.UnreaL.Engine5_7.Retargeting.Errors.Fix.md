## OpenAI ChatGPT v1.2025.330 Retargeting.Errors.Fix.md

**Q: In Unreal Engine latest I encounter retargetting errors when attempting to map Manny’s animations onto my meta human!**

**A:** You need to retarget via the IK Rig / IK Retargeter pipeline, with correct rigs, chains, and poses for both Manny and the MetaHuman. Most “Manny → MetaHuman” errors come from mismatched skeletons, missing IK goals, or bad retarget poses.

Below is a compact checklist you can run through.

---

## 1. Verify you are using the correct system

1. Use IK Retargeting, not the old Retarget Manager
   The legacy Retarget Manager path is effectively deprecated in UE5; Epic’s newer workflow for Manny/Quinn and MetaHumans is the IK Rig + IK Retargeter system.([YouTube][1])

2. Confirm the source animations are truly on the UE5 Manny skeleton
   UE5 Manny/Quinn use a new “UE5 Mannequin” skeleton that shares the core hierarchy with MetaHumans.([Epic Games Developers][2])

   * If the clip is still on the UE4 mannequin skeleton, first retarget UE4 → UE5 Manny, then Manny → MetaHuman.

---

## 2. Required assets and minimal setup

You should end up with:

* IK Rig for Manny (source), e.g. `IK_UE5_Mannequin`
* IK Rig for MetaHuman body (target), e.g. `IK_MetaHuman`
* IK Retargeter asset: `RTG_Manny_To_MetaHuman` (name arbitrary)

If the template / MetaHuman import did not auto-create these:

1. Create IK Rig for Manny:

   * Right-click Manny’s skeleton → Create → IK Rig.
   * Add bone chains:

     * Spine: `pelvis → spine_01 → spine_02 → spine_03 → neck_01 → head`
     * Legs: `thigh_l → calf_l → foot_l → ball_l` (same for `_r`)
     * Arms: `clavicle_l → upperarm_l → lowerarm_l → hand_l` (same for `_r`)
   * Add IK goals for hands and feet if you need foot/hand contact stability.

2. Create IK Rig for MetaHuman body:

   * Use the MetaHuman body skeleton (`metahuman_base_skel` or equivalent).([Yelzkizi.org][3])
   * Add the same logical chains (spine, arms, legs, head).
   * Ensure naming is consistent at the chain level (e.g. both rigs have “Spine”, “Arm_L”, “Leg_R” etc.).

3. Create IK Retargeter:

   * Right-click Manny IK Rig → Create → IK Retargeter.
   * Set:

     * Source IK Rig: Manny rig
     * Target IK Rig: MetaHuman rig (e.g. `IK_MetaHuman`)([Yelzkizi.org][4])

---

## 3. Set Root and pelvis correctly (root motion issues)

Typical problems: sliding, drifting, character offset, “exploding” pelvis.

In both IK Rigs:

1. Set Retarget Root:

   * In each IK Rig, right-click the top node (`root` or equivalent) → “Set as Retarget Root”.([Epic Games Developers][5])
2. Ensure pelvis is part of the spine chain, not a separate chain.
3. In the IK Retargeter, for root-motion animations:

   * Enable root translation copying / root motion where needed.
   * Preview the walk/run; if the MetaHuman moves “in place” while Manny translates, check that the Retarget Root is identical on both rigs.

---

## 4. Retarget pose alignment (twisted arms, raised shoulders, weird stance)

Most “it looks wrong but doesn’t crash” problems are pose mismatches:

1. Open the IK Retargeter:

   * Set Source Preview mesh to Manny, Target Preview mesh to your MetaHuman body mesh.
2. Retarget Pose:

   * Use “Edit Retarget Pose” on the target:

     * Align MetaHuman to Manny’s reference pose (UE5 characters often use an A-pose; some assets use a T-pose).
     * Fix:

       * Shoulders too high / low
       * Hands too close/far from body
       * Feet crossing or too wide
3. Height differences:

   * If your MetaHuman is shorter/taller, IK goals may be in bad positions, especially for arms/hands. Height differences are a known cause for odd arm positions; you may need to adjust the IK goals or re-pose arms.([Epic Developer Community Forums][6])

After alignment, save the retarget pose and re-preview the animations.

---

## 5. Common error classes and targeted fixes

Without your exact messages, these are the usual Manny → MetaHuman failure modes:

1. “Incompatible skeleton / cannot retarget”

   * Cause: Animation is on UE4 mannequin, not UE5 Manny.
   * Fix:

     * Use Epic’s UE4→UE5 retargeter to migrate to Manny first, then use your Manny→MetaHuman IK Retargeter.([YouTube][1])

2. Character plays but:

   * Arms / legs misaligned
   * Hands way too high or low
   * Feet sliding excessively
   * Fix:

     * Verify chains on both rigs: same count and same logical mapping.
     * Ensure IK goals for feet/hands exist on both rigs.
     * Adjust Target Retarget Pose (mostly arm and shoulder rotation).
     * Optionally tweak “Target Mesh Offset” / scale in Retargeter to address height.

3. Root motion wrong:

   * Character teleports, drifts, or spins:

     * Check Retarget Root set correctly on both rigs (same bone name / same level).
     * In Retargeter, verify root translation settings and whether the original animation is authored with root motion.

4. MetaHuman-specific pitfalls:

   * Using the wrong MetaHuman skeletal mesh:

     * Use the “body” or “full-body” skeletal mesh with the standard MetaHuman base skeleton. Face-only or separate clothing meshes will not behave correctly.
   * If fingers look broken:

     * Make sure your chains include fingers or disable finger chains initially, then add them back once the core pose looks correct.

## 6. Minimal “from scratch” recipe

If you want to nuke mistakes and rebuild clean:

1. Start from a fresh UE5 Third-Person template (Manny).
2. Add your MetaHuman via the MetaHuman plugin / Quixel Bridge.
3. Confirm:

   * Manny IK Rig exists.
   * MetaHuman IK Rig exists (if not, create `IK_MetaHuman`).
4. Create `RTG_Manny_MetaHuman` IK Retargeter:

   * Source: Manny IK Rig
   * Target: MetaHuman IK Rig
   * Assign Manny as Source Preview, MetaHuman as Target Preview.
5. In the Retargeter:

   * Load a Manny animation sequence as the Source Asset.
   * Fix Target Retarget Pose as described above.
   * Verify the preview looks acceptable.
6. When satisfied:

   * “Export Animations” from the Retargeter to bake MetaHuman-specific animation assets.
   * Use those new animations in your MetaHuman’s Animation Blueprint / Sequencer.

If you paste one of the exact error messages or describe the visual failure mode (e.g., “arms behind back,” “offset in world,” “error XYZ in Output Log”), I can map it more precisely to a root cause and a minimal fix.
