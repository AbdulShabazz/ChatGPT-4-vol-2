**Q: I have Verizon Apple One. Is it possible to add or swap in Apple News Plus or equivalent?**

**A:** No. Verizon’s Apple One perk is only the Individual or Family tier (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, iCloud+). It does not include Apple News+. Verizon does not offer a swap to add News+ or an upgrade to Apple One Premier on the perk. If you buy Apple One Premier or standalone Apple News+ directly from Apple, it runs alongside your Verizon Apple One and does not replace it. ([Verizon][1], [Apple][2])

Options, with current pricing:

* Keep Verizon Apple One, add Apple News+ directly from Apple for \$12.99/mo. Shareable with Family Sharing. ([Apple][3])
* Cancel the Verizon Apple One perk and subscribe to Apple One Premier from Apple for \$37.95/mo (adds News+ and Fitness+, 2 TB iCloud+ for up to six people). ([Apple][2])
* If you keep both, Verizon’s Apple One (Individual/Family) and Apple’s Apple One Premier will run at the same time, resulting in overlapping subscriptions. ([Verizon][1])

Verizon references:

* Apple One perk = Individual or Family only; lists included services; perk pricing noted (\$15/mo perk for Individual, \$20/mo for Family). ([Verizon][4])

Apple references:

* Apple One tier contents and prices, including Premier with News+. ([Apple][2])
* Apple News+ standalone price and inclusion in Premier. ([Apple][3])

**Q: Compare Apple One Premiere to Verizon Apple One, in table form. Be sure to include relevant specs as well as theoretical price-to-value, as well as if a plan exists which combines Verizon Apple One and Apple One Premiere. iCloud / iCloud Plus is unimportant for me in any plan.**

**A:** Short answer: No combined plan exists. Apple One Premier is only from Apple. Verizon Apple One is a discounted add-on for Individual or Family. They can run in parallel with separate billing and no credit netting. ([Verizon][1])

Calculations reflect simple sum of current list prices minus bundle price, and value/price ratio. ([Apple][3])

### Does any plan combine Verizon Apple One with Apple One Premier?

No. If you hold Apple One Premier directly and add Verizon’s Apple One perk, Apple continues billing Premier and Verizon bills the perk. Subscriptions run concurrently. There is no upgrade or “pay the difference” path. Cancel one to avoid overlap. ([Verizon][1])

### Notes

* Verizon also states you can upgrade the \$15 Individual perk to the \$20 Family perk in My Verizon. ([Verizon][1])
* Verizon’s legacy “One Unlimited for iPhone” plan included Apple One at no extra cost but is no longer available to add. Existing subscribers may keep or add lines. ([Verizon][4])
