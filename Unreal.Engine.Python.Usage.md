**Q:** Unreal Engine Python support is mainly for scripting, but is not supported in direct game design correct ? Can you provide an example if otherwise ?

**A:** Yes, you are correct that Unreal Engine's **Python support** is primarily used for **scripting** and **automation** tasks, rather than for direct game design or runtime game logic. Unreal Engine provides Python as a high-level scripting interface mainly for tasks such as:

- **Automating editor workflows** (e.g., batch processing assets, automating content import/export)
- **Creating custom tools** to assist in level design or asset management
- **Running build scripts** or batch operations
- **Extending the Unreal Editor functionality**

Python is **not designed** to handle real-time game logic or gameplay scripting in Unreal Engine. For that purpose, Unreal Engine uses **Blueprints** (visual scripting) or **C++** for more advanced and performance-critical code.

### Example of Python in Game Design (with Editor Automation Focus)

While Python is not used for direct game logic, it can still assist in game design by automating repetitive tasks in the **Unreal Editor**. Here's an example of a Python script used to automate **asset import** or **scene setup** in Unreal Engine.

```python
import unreal

# Define an asset import task
def import_asset(file_path, destination_path):
    task = unreal.AssetImportTask()
    task.filename = file_path
    task.destination_path = destination_path
    task.automated = True
    task.save = True
    return task

# Import multiple assets
def import_multiple_assets(file_paths, destination_path):
    tasks = [import_asset(file, destination_path) for file in file_paths]
    unreal.AssetToolsHelpers.get_asset_tools().import_asset_tasks(tasks)

# Example usage: Importing assets from a directory
file_paths = [
    '/path/to/your/asset1.fbx',
    '/path/to/your/asset2.fbx',
]

destination_path = '/Game/MyAssets'
import_multiple_assets(file_paths, destination_path)
```

### Explanation:

- **Automating Asset Import:** The Python script automates the task of importing assets (e.g., `.fbx` files) into the Unreal Engine content browser. This could save significant time during the asset creation process.
- **Scene Setup:** Similar scripts can be created for tasks like creating and placing objects in a level, configuring lights, or generating terrain.

### Limitations:

- **No Real-Time Game Logic**: Python in Unreal Engine does not have the performance characteristics necessary for real-time game execution (e.g., controlling player movement, AI behavior, or physics), which are typically done in **C++** or **Blueprints**.
- **Editor-Focused**: Python scripts are typically run inside the Unreal Editor, not as part of the game runtime. You would not package a Python script as part of your game.

In summary, while Python in Unreal Engine is not used for game logic, it is a powerful tool for **editor scripting** and can significantly enhance and speed up the **game design process**. If you're looking for runtime game logic, you'd need to use **Blueprints** or **C++**.
