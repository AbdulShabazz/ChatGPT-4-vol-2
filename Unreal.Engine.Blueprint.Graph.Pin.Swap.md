**Q:** I would like to patch the unreal engine source to swap crossing parameter pins in the blueprint graph editor to prevent their wires from crossing. What project directory files will be effected and what changes will need to be made? Please include all required source code!

**A:** Patching Unreal Engine's source to modify the Blueprint Graph Editor for swapping parameter pins to prevent wire crossings is an advanced task that involves understanding and altering the engine's graph layout algorithms. Below is a comprehensive guide outlining the necessary steps, affected files, and example source code modifications to achieve this functionality.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**

- **Unreal Engine Source Access**: Ensure you have access to the Unreal Engine source code from [Epic Games' GitHub repository](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine). You need to have a GitHub account linked with Epic Games to access the repository.
  
- **Development Environment**: Set up a suitable development environment with Visual Studio (2019 or later) or another compatible IDE. Ensure all required dependencies are installed.

- **Backup**: Always back up your engine source and any projects before making modifications.

---

## **2. Understanding the Blueprint Graph Editor Structure**

The Blueprint Graph Editor's pin layout and wire routing are primarily managed within the `BlueprintGraph` and `GraphEditor` modules. Key components involved include:

- **SGraphPin**: Manages individual pin rendering and interaction.
- **SGraphNode**: Handles the overall node layout, including pin arrangement.
- **Graph Layout Algorithms**: Determine how nodes and pins are positioned and connected.

---

## **3. Identifying Relevant Source Files**

The primary files you'll interact with are:

- **Pin Handling**:
  - `Engine/Source/Editor/BlueprintGraph/Private/SGraphPin.cpp`
  - `Engine/Source/Editor/BlueprintGraph/Public/SGraphPin.h`

- **Node Layout**:
  - `Engine/Source/Editor/BlueprintGraph/Private/SGraphNode.cpp`
  - `Engine/Source/Editor/BlueprintGraph/Public/SGraphNode.h`

- **Graph Layout**:
  - `Engine/Source/Editor/GraphEditor/Private/GraphLayout.cpp`
  - `Engine/Source/Editor/GraphEditor/Public/GraphLayout.h`

---

## **4. Modifying Pin Order to Prevent Wire Crossing**

To prevent wires from crossing, you can implement a sorting mechanism that arranges pins in a specific order based on certain criteria (e.g., pin names, data types). Here's how you can achieve this:

### **a. Sorting Pins in `SGraphPin.cpp`**

**File**: `Engine/Source/Editor/BlueprintGraph/Private/SGraphPin.cpp`

**Objective**: Override the default pin arrangement to sort pins and adjust their positions to minimize wire crossings.

**Steps**:

1. **Override the `Construct` Method**: Add logic to sort sibling pins whenever a pin is constructed.

2. **Implement Sorting Logic**: Define a sorting function based on your criteria (e.g., alphabetical order).

3. **Update Pin Positions**: Recalculate the positions of pins after sorting to reflect the new order.

**Example Code**:

```cpp
// SGraphPin.cpp

#include "SGraphPin.h"
#include "SGraphNode.h"
#include "GraphEditorSettings.h"
#include "BlueprintEditorUtils.h"
#include "Widgets/Layout/SBorder.h"
#include "Widgets/Text/STextBlock.h"

void SGraphPin::Construct(const FArguments& InArgs, UEdGraphPin* InPin)
{
    // Existing construction logic
    SGraphPinBase::Construct(SGraphPinBase::FArguments(), InPin);

    // After initial setup, sort sibling pins
    SortSiblingPins();
}

void SGraphPin::SortSiblingPins()
{
    UEdGraphNode* OwningNode = GetOwningNode();
    if (!OwningNode)
    {
        return;
    }

    // Retrieve all pins of the same direction (input or output)
    TArray<UEdGraphPin*> SiblingPins = OwningNode->GetPinsByDirection(PinObj->Direction);

    // Sort pins alphabetically by name
    SiblingPins.Sort([](const UEdGraphPin& A, const UEdGraphPin& B) -> bool
    {
        return A.PinName.ToString() < B.PinName.ToString();
    });

    // Update the owning node's pin order
    OwningNode->Pins.Empty();
    OwningNode->Pins.Append(SiblingPins);

    // Notify the graph editor to refresh the layout
    if (UEdGraph* Graph = OwningNode->GetGraph())
    {
        Graph->NotifyGraphChanged();
    }
}
```

### **b. Adjusting Node Layout in `SGraphNode.cpp`**

**File**: `Engine/Source/Editor/BlueprintGraph/Private/SGraphNode.cpp`

**Objective**: Modify the node's layout to position pins based on the newly sorted order.

**Steps**:

1. **Override the Layout Function**: Adjust the node's layout logic to position pins vertically based on their sorted order.

2. **Calculate Pin Positions**: Determine the Y-offset for each pin to ensure they are spaced appropriately, minimizing wire crossings.

**Example Code**:

```cpp
// SGraphNode.cpp

#include "SGraphNode.h"
#include "SGraphPin.h"
#include "GraphEditorSettings.h"

void SGraphNode::ArrangePins()
{
    // Existing arrangement logic
    // ...

    // Retrieve sorted pins
    TArray<UEdGraphPin*> SortedPins = GetNodeObj()->Pins;

    // Define spacing between pins
    const float PinVerticalSpacing = 20.0f;
    float CurrentY = 0.0f;

    // Iterate through sorted pins and set their positions
    for (int32 PinIndex = 0; PinIndex < SortedPins.Num(); ++PinIndex)
    {
        UEdGraphPin* Pin = SortedPins[PinIndex];
        TSharedPtr<SGraphPin> GraphPin = FindPinWidget(Pin);
        if (GraphPin.IsValid())
        {
            // Calculate Y position
            FVector2D PinPosition = FVector2D(0.0f, CurrentY);
            GraphPin->SetPosition(PinPosition);

            // Update Y for next pin
            CurrentY += PinVerticalSpacing;
        }
    }
}
```

### **c. Updating Graph Layout in `GraphLayout.cpp`**

**File**: `Engine/Source/Editor/GraphEditor/Private/GraphLayout.cpp`

**Objective**: Ensure the overall graph layout accounts for the new pin ordering to maintain a clean wire layout.

**Steps**:

1. **Override Layout Algorithms**: Modify existing layout algorithms to respect the new pin ordering.

2. **Recalculate Wire Paths**: Adjust wire routing paths based on the new pin positions to prevent crossings.

**Example Code**:

```cpp
// GraphLayout.cpp

#include "GraphLayout.h"
#include "SGraphNode.h"
#include "SGraphPin.h"

void FGraphLayout::ArrangeNodes()
{
    // Existing layout logic
    // ...

    // Iterate through all nodes to arrange pins
    for (TSharedPtr<SGraphNode> Node : GraphNodes)
    {
        if (Node.IsValid())
        {
            Node->ArrangePins();
        }
    }

    // Additional logic to optimize wire paths
    OptimizeWirePaths();
}

void FGraphLayout::OptimizeWirePaths()
{
    // Implement logic to adjust wire paths based on sorted pin positions
    // This could involve recalculating spline points or using a routing algorithm
}
```

---

## **5. Rebuilding the Engine**

After making the above modifications:

1. **Generate Project Files**: Run `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` (Windows) or the equivalent for your OS.

2. **Build the Engine**: Open the solution in Visual Studio and build the engine. Address any compilation errors that arise due to the changes.

3. **Launch the Editor**: Once built, launch the Unreal Editor to test the changes.

---

## **6. Testing Your Changes**

1. **Open a Blueprint**: Create or open an existing Blueprint in the Blueprint Graph Editor.

2. **Add Nodes with Multiple Pins**: Add nodes that have multiple input or output pins to observe the new pin ordering.

3. **Connect Wires**: Connect wires between pins to verify that the new ordering minimizes or eliminates wire crossings.

4. **Iterate as Needed**: Based on the results, you may need to tweak the sorting criteria or layout spacing to achieve optimal wire routing.

---

## **7. Additional Enhancements**

- **Dynamic Sorting**: Implement dynamic sorting based on usage frequency or connection patterns to further optimize wire layouts.

- **User Preferences**: Allow users to choose their preferred pin sorting criteria via the Editor Preferences.

- **Advanced Layout Algorithms**: Integrate more sophisticated graph layout algorithms (e.g., force-directed layouts) to handle complex graphs.

---

## **8. Important Considerations**

- **Engine Updates**: Modifying the engine source can complicate updates. Keep track of changes to merge them with future engine updates.

- **Performance**: Ensure that the new layout logic does not introduce significant performance overhead, especially in large Blueprint graphs.

- **Compatibility**: Test extensively to ensure that your changes do not interfere with other editor functionalities or plugins.

- **Documentation**: Document your changes thoroughly to aid future maintenance and updates.

---

## **Conclusion**

By following the steps outlined above, you can modify Unreal Engine's Blueprint Graph Editor to reorder parameter pins, thereby reducing or preventing wire crossings. This enhancement improves the readability and usability of complex Blueprints. Remember to thoroughly test your changes and consider contributing back to the Unreal Engine community if your solution can benefit others.

*Note: The provided code snippets are illustrative examples. Depending on the specific version of Unreal Engine and its internal architecture, additional adjustments may be necessary. Always refer to the latest Unreal Engine documentation and source code comments for guidance.*

**Q:** I first need to determine if wires from the same node indeed cross!

**A:** Determining whether wires from the same node in Unreal Engine's Blueprint Graph Editor cross is a crucial first step before implementing any modifications to prevent such crossings. This process involves analyzing the positions of the pins and the paths of the connecting wires to identify intersections. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you achieve this, including an understanding of the underlying architecture, methods to detect wire crossings, and example source code to facilitate your implementation.

---

## **1. Understanding Blueprint Wire Representation**

Before detecting wire crossings, it's essential to understand how wires (also known as connections) are represented within the Blueprint Graph Editor:

- **Wires as Splines**: In Unreal Engine, wires between pins are typically rendered as spline curves. However, for the purpose of collision detection (i.e., determining if two wires cross), it's practical to approximate these splines as straight lines or simplified curves.

- **Pin Positions**: Each pin on a node has a specific position within the graph editor's coordinate system. These positions are used as start and end points for the wires.

- **Connection Data**: Each wire connects two pins, one on the current node and another on a different node. The wire's path is determined by these pin positions and the graph layout algorithm.

---

## **2. Accessing Pin and Wire Information**

To detect wire crossings, you need access to the positions of the pins and the connections between them. Here's how you can access this information:

### **a. Accessing Pin Positions**

Each `UEdGraphPin` has associated metadata that includes its position within the node. You can retrieve this information using the following steps:

1. **Get the Owning Node**: For a given pin, retrieve the node it belongs to.

2. **Retrieve Pin Position**: Access the graphical representation of the pin to get its position.

### **b. Accessing Wire Connections**

Wires are represented by `UEdGraphPin` connections. Each wire connects two pins (source and target). You can iterate through these connections to analyze potential crossings.

---

## **3. Implementing Wire Crossing Detection**

To determine if any two wires from the same node cross, follow these steps:

### **a. Define Wire Segments**

For simplicity, approximate each wire as a straight line between its source and target pin positions. Each wire can then be represented as a line segment with two endpoints:

- **Wire A**: Defined by points `(A1, A2)`
- **Wire B**: Defined by points `(B1, B2)`

### **b. Line Segment Intersection Algorithm**

Implement an algorithm to check if two line segments intersect. A commonly used method is the [Orientation Method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-two-given-line-segments-intersect/), which determines the orientation of ordered triplets and checks for general and special cases of intersection.

### **c. Sample Implementation in C++**

Below is a sample implementation in C++ that you can integrate into Unreal Engine's source code. This example assumes you have access to the necessary Unreal Engine modules and classes.

```cpp
// WireCrossingDetector.h

#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "EdGraph/EdGraphPin.h"
#include "BlueprintGraph/Classes/K2Node.h"

                                        const FVector2D& p2, const FVector2D& q2);

    /**

     */
    static int Orientation(const FVector2D& p, const FVector2D& q, const FVector2D& r);
};
```

```cpp
// WireCrossingDetector.cpp

#include "WireCrossingDetector.h"

bool FWireCrossingDetector::DoesAnyWireCross(AK2Node* Node)
{
    if (!Node)
    {
        return false;
    }

    // Retrieve all output pins (you can modify to include input pins if needed)
    TArray<UEdGraphPin*> OutputPins = Node->GetAllPins().FilterByPredicate([](UEdGraphPin* Pin) {
        return Pin->Direction == EGPD_Output;
    });

    // Store wire segments as pairs of FVector2D
    TArray<TPair<FVector2D, FVector2D>> WireSegments;

    for (UEdGraphPin* OutputPin : OutputPins)
    {
        if (OutputPin->LinkedTo.Num() == 0)
        {
            continue; // No connections
        }

            // Note: Accessing SGraphPin requires interaction with Slate widgets, which might not be directly accessible here.
            // You might need to pass in additional information or use a different approach to get pin positions.

            // Placeholder positions (replace with actual pin positions)

    int o1 = Orientation(p1, q1, p2);
    int o2 = Orientation(p1, q1, q2);
    int o3 = Orientation(p2, q2, p1);
    int o4 = Orientation(p2, q2, q1);

    // General case
    if (o1 != o2 && o3 != o4)
    {
        return true;
    }

    // Special Cases

    if (FMath::IsNearlyZero(val))
    {
        return 0; // Colinear
    }
    return (val > 0) ? 1 : 2; // Clockwise or Counterclockwise
}
```

### **d. Integrating the Detector into the Graph Editor**

To utilize the `FWireCrossingDetector`, you need to determine where in the Blueprint Graph Editor's workflow to invoke the detection. A suitable place is during the node layout or when wires are connected/disconnected. Here's an example of how to integrate the detector:

```cpp
// ExampleIntegration.cpp

#include "WireCrossingDetector.h"
#include "BlueprintEditor.h"
#include "K2Node.h"

void SomeBlueprintGraphHandlerFunction(AK2Node* Node)
{
    if (FWireCrossingDetector::DoesAnyWireCross(Node))
    {
        // Handle the crossing detection
        // For example, log a warning or trigger a layout adjustment
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Wire crossing detected in node: %s"), *Node->GetName());
    }
    else
    {
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("No wire crossings detected in node: %s"), *Node->GetName());
    }
}
```

**Note**: Accessing pin positions accurately requires interfacing with the Slate UI framework (`SGraphPin` and `SGraphNode`). This can be complex because Slate widgets are separate from the core graph data structures. One approach is to extend the `AK2Node` class or related classes to expose pin positions or implement observer patterns to retrieve this information during layout updates.

---

## **4. Handling Pin Positions**

To accurately detect wire crossings, you need the precise screen (graph editor) positions of each pin. Here's how you can approach this:

### **a. Accessing `SGraphPin` Positions**

`SGraphPin` is the Slate widget responsible for rendering and managing individual pins. To retrieve their positions:

1. **Override `SGraphPin` Rendering**: Modify the `SGraphPin` class to expose pin positions when they are rendered or updated.

2. **Store Pin Positions**: Maintain a mapping of `UEdGraphPin` to `FVector2D` positions that can be accessed by the `FWireCrossingDetector`.

### **b. Example: Extending `SGraphPin` to Store Positions**

```cpp
// SGraphPin_Extended.h

#pragma once

#include "SGraphPin.h"

class SGraphPin_Extended : public SGraphPin
{
public:
    SLATE_BEGIN_ARGS(SGraphPin_Extended) {}
    SLATE_END_ARGS()

    void Construct(const FArguments& InArgs, UEdGraphPin* InPin) override;

    // Getter for pin position
    FVector2D GetPinPosition() const { return PinPosition; }

protected:
    // Override the method where the pin's position is determined
    virtual void OnArrangeChildren(const FGeometry& AllottedGeometry, FArrangedChildren& ArrangedChildren) const override;

private:
    FVector2D PinPosition;
};
```

```cpp
// SGraphPin_Extended.cpp

#include "SGraphPin_Extended.h"

void SGraphPin_Extended::Construct(const FArguments& InArgs, UEdGraphPin* InPin)
{
    SGraphPin::Construct(SGraphPin::FArguments(), InPin);
}

void SGraphPin_Extended::OnArrangeChildren(const FGeometry& AllottedGeometry, FArrangedChildren& ArrangedChildren) const
{
    SGraphPin::OnArrangeChildren(AllottedGeometry, ArrangedChildren);

    // Assuming the pin is the first child; adjust as necessary
    if (ArrangedChildren.Num() > 0)
    {
        const FArrangedWidget& ArrangedPin = ArrangedChildren.GetChildAt(0);
        PinPosition = ArrangedPin.Geometry.AbsolutePosition;
    }
}
```

**Integration Considerations**:

- **Custom Pin Widgets**: Replace standard `SGraphPin` instances with your extended `SGraphPin_Extended` to capture pin positions.

- **Data Sharing**: Ensure that the captured `PinPosition` is accessible to the `FWireCrossingDetector`. This might involve storing positions in a centralized location or passing them as parameters.

### **c. Synchronizing Pin Positions with `FWireCrossingDetector`**

Modify the `FWireCrossingDetector` to accept pin positions:

```cpp
// Updated WireCrossingDetector.h

#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "EdGraph/EdGraphPin.h"
#include "BlueprintGraph/Classes/K2Node.h"

/**
 * Utility class to detect wire crossings within a node's pins.
 */
class FWireCrossingDetector
{
public:
    /**
     * Checks if any two wires from the same node cross each other.
     * @param Node The node to check for wire crossings.
     * @param PinPositions A map of UEdGraphPin to their FVector2D positions.
     * @return True if any crossing is detected, otherwise false.
     */
    static bool DoesAnyWireCross(AK2Node* Node, const TMap<UEdGraphPin*, FVector2D>& PinPositions);

    // ... (other methods remain unchanged)
};
```

```cpp
// Updated WireCrossingDetector.cpp

#include "WireCrossingDetector.h"

bool FWireCrossingDetector::DoesAnyWireCross(AK2Node* Node, const TMap<UEdGraphPin*, FVector2D>& PinPositions)
{
    if (!Node)
    {
        return false;
    }

    // Retrieve all output pins (modify as needed)
    TArray<UEdGraphPin*> OutputPins = Node->GetAllPins().FilterByPredicate([](UEdGraphPin* Pin) {
        return Pin->Direction == EGPD_Output;
    });

    // Store wire segments as pairs of FVector2D
    TArray<TPair<FVector2D, FVector2D>> WireSegments;

    for (UEdGraphPin* OutputPin : OutputPins)
    {
        if (OutputPin->LinkedTo.Num() == 0)
        {
            continue; // No connections
        }

        for (UEdGraphPin* LinkedPin : OutputPin->LinkedTo)
        {
            // Retrieve pin positions from the map
            FVector2D OutputPinPosition;
            FVector2D LinkedPinPosition;

            if (!PinPositions.Contains(OutputPin) || !PinPositions.Contains(LinkedPin))
            {
                continue; // Positions not available
            }

            OutputPinPosition = PinPositions[OutputPin];
            LinkedPinPosition = PinPositions[LinkedPin];

            WireSegments.Emplace(TPair<FVector2D, FVector2D>(OutputPinPosition, LinkedPinPosition));
        }
    }

    // Check all pairs of wire segments for intersection
    for (int32 i = 0; i < WireSegments.Num(); ++i)
    {
        for (int32 j = i + 1; j < WireSegments.Num(); ++j)
        {
            const TPair<FVector2D, FVector2D>& WireA = WireSegments[i];
            const TPair<FVector2D, FVector2D>& WireB = WireSegments[j];

            if (DoLineSegmentsIntersect(WireA.Key, WireA.Value, WireB.Key, WireB.Value))
            {
                return true; // Crossing detected
            }
        }
    }

    return false; // No crossings
}
```

**Usage Example**:

```cpp
// ExampleIntegration.cpp

#include "WireCrossingDetector.h"
#include "BlueprintEditor.h"
#include "K2Node.h"
#include "SGraphPin_Extended.h"

void SomeBlueprintGraphHandlerFunction(AK2Node* Node, const TMap<UEdGraphPin*, FVector2D>& PinPositions)
{
    if (FWireCrossingDetector::DoesAnyWireCross(Node, PinPositions))
    {
        // Handle the crossing detection
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Wire crossing detected in node: %s"), *Node->GetName());

        // Optionally, trigger a layout adjustment or notify the user
    }
    else
    {
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("No wire crossings detected in node: %s"), *Node->GetName());
    }
}
```

## **5. Visual Debugging and Validation**

To ensure that your wire crossing detection is functioning correctly, implement visual debugging tools:

### **a. Drawing Wire Segments and Crossings**

Use Unreal Engine's drawing utilities to render wire segments and highlight crossings:

```cpp
// ExampleVisualDebugger.cpp

#include "WireCrossingDetector.h"
#include "Engine/Canvas.h"
#include "CanvasItem.h"
#include "Kismet/KismetSystemLibrary.h"

void DrawWireSegments(UCanvas* Canvas, const TArray<TPair<FVector2D, FVector2D>>& WireSegments, const TArray<TPair<int32, int32>>& CrossingIndices)
{
    FCanvasLineItem LineItemA, LineItemB;

    // Draw all wire segments
    for (const auto& Wire : WireSegments)
    {
        LineItemA = FCanvasLineItem(Wire.Key, Wire.Value);
        LineItemA.SetColor(FLinearColor::Green);
        Canvas->DrawItem(LineItemA);
    }

    // Highlight crossing wires
    for (const auto& Indices : CrossingIndices)
    {
        const TPair<FVector2D, FVector2D>& WireA = WireSegments[Indices.Key];
        const TPair<FVector2D, FVector2D>& WireB = WireSegments[Indices.Value];

        // Draw crossing in red
        LineItemA = FCanvasLineItem(WireA.Key, WireA.Value);
        LineItemA.SetColor(FLinearColor::Red);
        Canvas->DrawItem(LineItemA);

        LineItemB = FCanvasLineItem(WireB.Key, WireB.Value);
        LineItemB.SetColor(FLinearColor::Red);
        Canvas->DrawItem(LineItemB);
    }
}
```

**Usage**: Call the `DrawWireSegments` function during the graph editor's paint phase, passing in the current wire segments and any detected crossings.

### **b. Logging Detailed Information**

Enhance logging to include detailed information about detected crossings, such as which wires are intersecting and their respective pins.

```cpp
// Enhanced Logging in WireCrossingDetector.cpp

bool FWireCrossingDetector::DoesAnyWireCross(AK2Node* Node, const TMap<UEdGraphPin*, FVector2D>& PinPositions)
{
    // ... (existing code)

    for (int32 i = 0; i < WireSegments.Num(); ++i)
    {
        for (int32 j = i + 1; j < WireSegments.Num(); ++j)
        {
            const TPair<FVector2D, FVector2D>& WireA = WireSegments[i];
            const TPair<FVector2D, FVector2D>& WireB = WireSegments[j];

            if (DoLineSegmentsIntersect(WireA.Key, WireA.Value, WireB.Key, WireB.Value))
            {
                UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Wire Crossing Detected between wires %d and %d in node %s"),
                    i, j, *Node->GetName());
                UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Wire %d: %s -> %s"), i, *OutputPins[i]->GetName(), *LinkedPins[i]->GetName());
                UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Wire %d: %s -> %s"), j, *OutputPins[j]->GetName(), *LinkedPins[j]->GetName());
                return true; // Crossing detected
            }
        }
    }

    // ... (existing code)
}
```

## **6. Performance Considerations**

When implementing wire crossing detection, especially in real-time as the user interacts with the graph editor, consider the following performance optimizations:

- **Caching Pin Positions**: Avoid recalculating pin positions on every detection cycle by caching positions and updating only when necessary (e.g., when nodes or pins move).

- **Efficient Algorithms**: Use efficient line intersection algorithms and minimize unnecessary computations by early exiting when possible.

- **Asynchronous Processing**: If the detection process is computationally intensive, consider performing it asynchronously to prevent blocking the editor's main thread.

---

## **7. Next Steps: Preventing Wire Crossings**

Once you've successfully detected wire crossings, the next phase involves modifying the Blueprint Graph Editor to rearrange pins or adjust wire paths to eliminate these crossings. This involves:

- **Pin Reordering**: Automatically rearranging the order of pins based on certain criteria (e.g., alphabetical order, connection frequency) to minimize the likelihood of wires crossing.

- **Wire Routing Adjustments**: Implementing smarter wire routing algorithms that can route wires around each other or use different spline paths to avoid intersections.

- **User Feedback**: Providing visual indicators or warnings to inform users about wire crossings and offer options to resolve them.

Implementing these features will enhance the usability and readability of Blueprints, especially in complex graphs.

---

## **8. Important Considerations**

- **Engine Source Modifications**: Modifying Unreal Engine's source code can have implications for future updates and compatibility. Ensure that you maintain a separate branch for your modifications and document changes thoroughly.

- **Testing**: Rigorously test your wire crossing detection and prevention mechanisms across various Blueprint configurations to ensure reliability and performance.

- **Community Resources**: Engage with the Unreal Engine community through forums and repositories. Others might have attempted similar modifications and can offer valuable insights or collaboration opportunities.

## **Conclusion**

Detecting wire crossings in Unreal Engine's Blueprint Graph Editor involves accessing pin positions, representing wires as line segments, and implementing intersection detection algorithms. By following the steps outlined above and integrating the provided sample code, you can effectively identify when wires from the same node cross. This foundational step paves the way for implementing strategies to prevent such crossings, ultimately enhancing the clarity and maintainability of your Blueprints.
