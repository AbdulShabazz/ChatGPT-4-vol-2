**Q: How difficult would it be for Tesla to support self-clearing faults?**

**A:** Tesla supporting *self-clearing faults* (meaning faults that clear themselves automatically once the triggering condition disappears, rather than requiring a service visit or manual reset) is both a technical and regulatory challenge. Here’s a breakdown of what makes it difficult:

---

### 1. **Current State of Tesla Fault Handling**

* Tesla vehicles already classify faults by severity:

  * **Transient/minor faults** (e.g., wheel slip, temporary sensor noise) often clear automatically after conditions normalize.
  * **Medium faults** (e.g., degraded sensor, intermittent communication loss) may persist until the car confirms stability over multiple drive cycles.
  * **Critical faults** (e.g., HV battery isolation, brake controller errors) typically remain latched until service clears them, regardless of whether the condition resolves.
* Tesla logs all Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) in non-volatile memory and uploads them via telemetry for remote diagnostics.

---

### 2. **Technical Barriers**

* **False negatives risk**: A self-clearing system that erases a persistent but intermittent problem could mask serious issues (e.g., partial HV battery cooling failure).
* **Complex sensor networks**: Tesla’s architecture includes dozens of ECUs and CAN bus nodes; deciding whether a “resolved” fault was truly a glitch or an impending failure requires machine-learning-like statistical monitoring.
* **Safety-critical domains**: Systems like brakes, steering, airbags, and HV systems must comply with ISO 26262 (ASIL-D in many cases). These standards require “latched” fault storage until a human review.
* **Software updates vs hardware wear**: Tesla’s OTA updates can resolve software bugs that caused spurious alerts, but self-clearing can’t fix actual component degradation (e.g., coolant sensor drift).

---

### 3. **Regulatory Barriers**

* **FMVSS and UNECE rules**: Automotive regulators mandate that safety-critical warnings (airbag, ABS, ESC, emissions OBD-II) remain visible until manually cleared. Self-clearing could be non-compliant.
* **OBD-II/EPA requirements**: In the U.S., emissions-related DTCs (P0xxx codes) must persist until multiple consecutive “trip cycles” confirm fault resolution. Tesla cannot override this without regulatory changes.

---

### 4. **Feasible Pathways**

* **Tiered clearing strategy**:

  * Transient non-safety faults (e.g., parking sensors blocked by rain, ultrasonic glitches) could be self-clearing after N drive cycles.
  * Predictive analytics: Tesla could use fleet-wide telemetry to identify benign patterns and allow auto-clear.
* **Owner-visible history**:

  * Even if faults clear themselves, Tesla could show drivers a “recently resolved issues” log, ensuring transparency.
* **Machine learning integration**:

  * Cloud-side aggregation of millions of vehicles would let Tesla distinguish between systemic vs. vehicle-specific issues before deciding auto-clear thresholds.

---

### 5. **Difficulty Rating**

* **Technically**: Moderate. Tesla already has the telemetry and ECU integration. Expanding self-clearing requires more robust statistical models.
* **Regulatory**: High. Compliance with FMVSS, UNECE, and OBD-II emissions rules makes blanket auto-clearing impossible. Only “non-regulated” fault domains (infotainment, convenience sensors, some driver-assist features) can be freely self-clearing.

---

**Conclusion:**
For Tesla, supporting widespread *self-clearing faults* is **more constrained by regulation than by engineering**. Technically, they could deploy machine-learning-driven auto-clearing tomorrow across their fleet. But legally, they would still have to leave many categories of faults latched until manual inspection or service clearance. Expect Tesla to expand auto-clearing in *convenience systems* (parking sensors, infotainment errors, etc.) but remain restricted in *safety-critical and emissions-related systems*.

Would you like me to give a **list of Tesla systems today that already self-clear vs those that legally must remain latched**? That way you can see exactly where the difficulty lies.
