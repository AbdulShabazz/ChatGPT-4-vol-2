**Q: Is there a Home key or equivalent on the Razer Blade 18" gaming laptop?**

**A:** Yes. There is no dedicated “Home”-labeled key on the Razer Blade 18, but the equivalent shortcut is:

* **Home:** `Fn` + `←` (Left Arrow)

On current Razer Blade models, the navigation keys are mapped as follows:

* `Fn` + `←` = Home
* `Fn` + `→` = End
* `Fn` + `↑` = Page Up
* `Fn` + `↓` = Page Down
* `Fn` + `Delete` = Insert ([Razer Support][1])

In text editors, `Shift` + `Fn` + `←` will usually select from the cursor to the start of the line (Home + Shift).
