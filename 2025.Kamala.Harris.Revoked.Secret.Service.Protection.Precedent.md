**Q: President Trump has revoked former u.s. vice president Kamala Harris secret service protection. Has this set a precedent?**

**A:** Short answer: **Yes—normatively.** It breaks with past practice for a sitting president to rescind a predecessor-approved extension of Secret Service protection for a **former vice president**, though it doesn’t change the underlying law.

* **What happened & when (fact pattern):** On **August 29, 2025**, the White House confirmed that President Trump **revoked** the previously extended U.S. Secret Service detail for former Vice President **Kamala Harris**, with the cancellation **taking effect Sept. 1, 2025**. Multiple outlets corroborated the memo directing DHS/USSS to end any coverage “beyond that required by law.” ([AP News][1], [ABC7 Los Angeles][2])

* **Baseline law (statutory authority):** By statute, former vice presidents (and spouse/children < 16) are entitled to USSS protection for **“not more than six months”** after leaving office; beyond that, the **Secretary of Homeland Security** may direct temporary protection **“at any time thereafter if … information or conditions warrant.”** In short, extensions are discretionary executive-branch decisions, not guaranteed entitlements. ([Legal Information Institute][3], [Congress.gov][4])

* **Past practice (extensions usually honored):**

  * **Dick Cheney (2009):** President Obama **extended** Cheney’s post-VP protection; there was no public revocation by a successor. ([CBS News][5])
  * **Al Gore (2001):** President Clinton signed a directive **extending** Gore’s coverage; again, no public successor revocation. ([Maryland Daily Record][6])
  * Analysts note that **prior presidents typically honored** their predecessors’ extension decisions for protectees. ([The Washington Post][7])

* **Has a president ever **revoked** a predecessor-approved **extension for a former VP**?** I can’t find a documented example before this week. Major outlets describe the Harris move as **a departure from prior norms** (extensions honored), rather than a continuation of a known pattern. That makes it **precedent-setting in practice**, even if **legally permissible** under the executive’s control of DHS/USSS tasking. ([The Washington Post][7])

* **Related (but distinct) revocations this year:** President Trump has **revoked USSS protection** for **Hunter and Ashley Biden** (adult children of a former president)—a different category from former VPs—and he also **terminated government-funded security** for former officials like **Mike Pompeo** and **Brian Hook** (State Department/Diplomatic Security, not USSS). These underscore a broader willingness to **withdraw protections** but aren’t direct precedents for **former-VP** coverage. ([Reuters][8], [Forbes][9], [The Guardian][10], [AP News][11])

* **Bottom line:**

  * **Legal precedent:** No—18 U.S.C. § 3056 still controls (6-month entitlement; DHS-directed extensions). ([Legal Information Institute][3])
  * **Normative/governance precedent:** **Yes**—this appears to be the **first publicly reported instance** of a president **rescinding a predecessor’s extension** for a **former vice president**, breaking with the custom of honoring such extensions. ([The Washington Post][7])
