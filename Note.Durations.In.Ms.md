**Q: What is the millisecond duration of common music notes?**

**A:** Common note durations depend on tempo. The key relationship:

* Quarter-note duration (ms) = 60,000 / BPM

From that:

* Whole note = 4 × quarter
* Half note = 2 × quarter
* Eighth note = ½ × quarter
* Sixteenth note = ¼ × quarter
* Thirty-second note = ⅛ × quarter
* Dotted note = 1.5 × the base note
* Triplet (3 in the time of 2) = (2/3) × the base note

Examples at typical tempos:

### At 60 BPM

* Whole: 4000 ms
* Half: 2000 ms
* Quarter: 1000 ms
* Eighth: 500 ms
* Sixteenth: 250 ms
* 32nd: 125 ms
* Dotted quarter: 1500 ms
* Quarter-note triplet: ≈ 667 ms

### At 90 BPM

* Whole: ≈ 2667 ms
* Half: ≈ 1333 ms
* Quarter: ≈ 667 ms
* Eighth: ≈ 333 ms
* Sixteenth: ≈ 167 ms
* 32nd: ≈ 83 ms
* Dotted quarter: 1000 ms
* Quarter-note triplet: ≈ 444 ms

### At 120 BPM

* Whole: 2000 ms
* Half: 1000 ms
* Quarter: 500 ms
* Eighth: 250 ms
* Sixteenth: 125 ms
* 32nd: 62.5 ms
* Dotted quarter: 750 ms
* Quarter-note triplet: ≈ 333 ms

If you specify a BPM you’re using, I can give a compact table tailored to that tempo (including more dotted values and different note types).
