1. Purpose and Scope

- Goal: To define the rules, regulations, and responsibilities associated with the installation, operation, and maintenance of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations on HOA property.  
- Scope: These bylaws apply to all residents, tenants, and authorized guests who use or seek to use the EV charging stations installed by the HOA.  
- Applicability: The rules herein pertain to stations located in parking areas adjacent to each building on the campus (e.g., Building A, Building B, etc.).

---

2. Definitions

- EV Charging Station: Any designated parking space equipped with an electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) charging unit, capable of delivering AC Level 2 (typically 240V, up to 40A–80A depending on equipment specification) power or otherwise as determined by the HOA.  
- Authorized User: Any HOA member, tenant, or guest who has been granted permission (through registration, fee payment, or other conditions) to use the EV charging stations.  
- Guest: Any non-resident authorized by an HOA member to use the premises or the EV charging station.  
- Operator/Administrator: The individual or management group responsible for the administration, billing, and general oversight of the EV charging facilities.  
- Charging Session: The period during which an EV is actively connected to the station and drawing electricity.

---

3. Installation and Equipment Specifications

- Number of Stations: Each building on the campus shall have at least one dedicated EV charging station; the HOA may expand the number of stations based on usage data and member demand.  
- Equipment Rating: All EV charging stations shall be installed according to local electrical codes (e.g., NEC, state building codes). A typical installation might include Level 2, 240V, 32A–48A capacity with a J1772 connector or other industry-standard connector.  
- Permitting and Inspections: The HOA shall secure proper electrical permits and inspections prior to installation or upgrade of any EV charging equipment.  

---

4. Resident Access

- Eligibility: Only residents in good standing (i.e., current on HOA dues and without outstanding violations) shall be eligible to access and use the on-site EV charging stations.  
- Registration Requirement: Residents must register their electric vehicles with the HOA’s property manager or designated Operator/Administrator. This registration includes submission of the vehicle’s make, model, and license plate information.  
- Access Controls:  
  - Each station may be equipped with an RFID card, mobile phone application, or code-based lock system.  
  - Authorized Users shall receive unique credentials to authenticate and enable charging.  
- Guest Usage:  
  - Residents may request guest privileges, subject to availability and any applicable guest fees.  
  - The resident sponsoring the guest shall assume liability for the guest’s compliance with these bylaws.

---

5. Charging Fees and Billing

- Fee Structure:  
  - A base fee (e.g., $0.15–$0.20 per kWh) may be charged to cover electricity consumption, plus a per-minute or per-hour rate (if desired) to incentivize prompt vehicle removal when charging completes.  
  - Alternatively, a flat monthly fee (e.g., $25–$50) may be instituted for unlimited or limited usage, to be determined by the HOA membership.  
- Payment Methods:  
  - Fees may be assessed as part of the monthly HOA dues or billed separately through a third-party billing service.  
  - Payment is required in full within the normal billing cycle (e.g., 30 days).  
- Late Payment and Delinquency:  
  - Users who fall behind on their charging fees may have their charging privileges revoked.  
  - Delinquent charges will be handled in the same manner as standard HOA dues, subject to late fees and potential legal action.

---

6. Parking and Time Limits

- Dedicated Spaces: EV charging spaces are reserved exclusively for actively charging vehicles. Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles or non-charging EVs are prohibited from occupying these spaces.  
- Max Duration:  
  - A maximum charging duration (e.g., 4 hours) may be enforced per session to allow fair access for all residents.  
  - Once a vehicle has completed its charge or reached the time limit, the owner must remove the vehicle from the charging space within 15–30 minutes.  
- Idle Fees:  
  - An idle fee (e.g., $4.50 per minute) may be imposed on vehicles remaining plugged in after charging completes.  
  - Idle fees help ensure turnover of EV charging spaces, preventing station hogging.

---

7. Scheduling and Reservations

- Reservation System:  
  - A web-based or mobile application may be used to reserve charging timeslots.  
  - Users must adhere to the start/end times of their reservations.  
- Drop-In Usage:  
  - If the station is unoccupied, Authorized Users may charge their vehicles on a first-come, first-served basis.  
  - Reserved users have priority if they arrive on time for their booked slot.  
- Cancellation Policy:  
  - Users are encouraged to cancel reservations they cannot keep, to free the station for others.  
  - Repeated no-shows or reservation abuses may result in temporary suspension of privileges.

---

8. Maintenance and Safety

- Maintenance Responsibility:  
  - The HOA or its designated Operator/Administrator is responsible for routine upkeep, inspection, and repair of the EV charging stations.  
  - All routine maintenance shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines, typically every 6–12 months depending on station usage.  
- Reporting Issues:  
  - Users must immediately report any damage, malfunctions, or hazards to the HOA management or Operator/Administrator.  
  - Email or phone hotlines may be established to streamline incident reporting.  
- Safety Guidelines:  
  - Users must follow equipment instructions (e.g., ensure the cable is stored properly, the connector is locked in place before charging starts, etc.).  
  - Unauthorized or improper modifications to the EVSE unit (e.g., tampering with cables, bypassing safety features) is strictly prohibited.

---

9. Liability and Insurance

- Resident Assumption of Risk: Users assume full responsibility for any damage or injury resulting from misuse or negligence while operating the equipment.  
- HOA Liability Limitation:  
  - The HOA is not responsible for damage to personal vehicles or charging cords unless caused by documented negligence in maintaining or repairing the equipment.  
  - Residents agree to indemnify and hold harmless the HOA from any claims arising out of individual misuse or misbehavior.  
- Insurance Coverage:  
  - The HOA may carry a general liability policy that includes coverage for EV charging equipment.  
  - Residents are encouraged to confirm their auto insurance covers charging-related incidents.

---

10. Enforcement and Penalties

- Violation Notice:  
  - Written or electronic notices shall be provided to individuals who violate any provisions of these bylaws.  
  - Violations include overstaying time limits, unpaid fees, unauthorized usage, tampering with equipment, or other infractions.  
- Progressive Disciplinary Actions:  
  1. First Offense: Warning or fine, as determined by the Board.  
  2. Second Offense: Increased fine, temporary loss of charging privileges (e.g., 30 days).  
  3. Third Offense: Substantial fine and indefinite revocation of privileges until resolved with the Board.  
- Fine Schedule: Specific fines (e.g., $25, $50, $100 for successive offenses) shall be published and periodically reviewed by the HOA Board.

---

11. Amendments and Future Upgrades

- Amendment Process:  
  - Any changes to these bylaws require a majority vote of the HOA Board or membership in accordance with the HOA’s standard governance rules.  
  - Proposed amendments must be circulated in writing at least 30 days prior to a vote.  
- Expansion and Upgrades:  
  - The HOA reserves the right to expand the EV charging network as demand grows, subject to budget and infrastructure constraints.  
  - Upgrades or modifications to existing stations may include higher charging speeds, additional features like Wi-Fi connectivity or advanced scheduling, etc.

---

12. References and Compliance

- Local and State Regulations:  
  - All installations and operations shall comply with relevant state and municipal codes.  
  - If local law requires the HOA to offer certain EV rights or allowances, these bylaws will be updated accordingly.  
- Industry Standards:  
  - Industry best practices as published by organizations such as the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) (e.g., SAE J1772 standards) and the National Electrical Code (NEC) will be observed.  
- Resources:  
  - For more information, residents may consult the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center (textual link: www.afdc.energy.gov) or local utility company guidelines on EV infrastructure.

  Below is a sample strategy that combines all three methods (first-come-first-served, scheduled/allotted windows, and appointment-only elements) in a single framework. This structure is particularly useful for communities that experience variable charging demand across different times of day and days of the week.

---

1. Overview of a Combined Access to Charging Strategy

- Weekday Daytime (e.g., 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM)  
  - Primary Access Method: First-Come-First-Served (i.e., FCFS).  
  - Rationale: Most residents are assumed to be at work or have flexible schedules. Overall utilization may be lower during daytime; thus, a simple FCFS approach works well to reduce administrative overhead.

- Overnight (e.g., 9:00 PM – 9:00 AM)  
  - Primary Access Method: Reserved unit owner charging windows.  
  - Secondary Method: FCFS if a reservation holder does not arrive within **25 minutes** of the reserved start time.  
  - Rationale: Overnight charging is popular for EV owners looking to leave their vehicles plugged in for several hours. Scheduled windows give predictability. However, the “25-minute grace period” ensures that an unused reservation won’t tie up a station all night.

- Weekends (Saturday & Sunday)
  - Peak Demand: Because weekends often see higher concurrent usage, designated time slots (like 2 or 3-hour blocks) can be assigned or booked ahead of time, especially during prime hours (e.g., 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM).  
  - Off-Peak Weekend Nights (e.g., after 9:00 PM): Follow the same overnight reserved window approach as weekdays.  
  - Rationale: Weekends exhibit a blend of midday “peak usage” and overnight sessions. By allocating shorter, pre-scheduled slots during the highest demand periods, more residents can access the chargers in turn.

2. Detailed Policy Components

A. Weekday Daytime (First-Come-First-Served)

1. Hours of Operation:  
   - Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM.  
   - Chargers remain physically accessible at all times, but official scheduling software does not process reservations in this window.

2. FCFS Rules:  
   - Residents may plug in if the station is free.  
   - A maximum usage limit of X hours (e.g., 2–4 hours) per session is recommended to ensure turnover.  
   - Idle Fees: If the vehicle remains connected after charging is complete, or exceeds the time limit, an idle fee (e.g., $4.50 per minute) begins to accumulate.

3. Administrative Considerations:  
   - Monitoring: The HOA or a third-party administrator periodically reviews usage logs, especially if reports of chronic station blocking surface.  
   - Load Management (Optional): If your charging infrastructure supports load balancing, the system can automatically reduce or distribute power among simultaneously plugged-in vehicles.

B. Overnight (Reserved Windows With FCFS Fallback)

1. Hours of Operation:  
   - Monday to Friday, 9:00 PM – 9:00 AM.

2. Reservation Windows:  
   - Residents can book discrete blocks (e.g., two 4-hour windows: 9:00 PM–1:00 AM, 1:00 AM–5:00 AM, or a similar arrangement).  
   - The exact block length should align with typical vehicle charging requirements (2–4 hours for an EV to reach a substantial state of charge on Level 2).

3. 25-Minute Grace Period:  
   - Once a resident’s reserved window begins, they have 25 minutes to occupy the station.  
   - After 25 minutes, if the reserved party has not arrived or started charging, the station reverts to FCFS availability until the end of that block.  
   - Example: If a resident is scheduled to start charging at 9:00 PM but hasn’t arrived by 9:25 PM, any other waiting resident is free to plug in.

4. Late Arrival and Overstay Policies:  
   - Late Arrival Beyond 25 Minutes: The original reservation is forfeited.  
   - Session Overrun: If a user’s charge runs beyond their reserved end time, the idle fee or an overstay fee immediately applies.

5. Administrative Considerations:  
   - Online or App-Based Scheduler: A user-friendly platform must be provided for residents to reserve windows and see real-time charger status.  
   - Notification System: Automatic email/text reminders at reservation start time and 15 minutes before the session ends encourage prompt moves.  
   - Penalties for No-Shows: Repeated no-shows or unused reservations could result in suspension of privileges or fines.

---

C. Weekends (Peak Demand)

1. Structured Daytime Slots (e.g., 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM)  
   - Time Slots: Divide the prime weekend hours into shorter blocks (e.g., 2-hour or 3-hour windows) to allow multiple vehicles to rotate through each charger in a single day.  
   - Reservations:  
     - Residents may reserve these blocks up to a certain number of times per week/month to prevent hoarding.  
     - A no-show grace period (e.g., 15–20 minutes) may be shorter than the overnight grace period to maintain tighter turnover.  
   - First-Come-First-Served (Unreserved Slots): If a slot is unbooked or the user forfeits, it reverts to FCFS for anyone to use until the next reserved time block begins.

2. Overnight Weekend Hours (9:00 PM – 9:00 AM)  
   - Follow the same Reserved Windows with 25-Minute Grace Period approach as weekdays.

3. High Traffic Policies:  
   - Multiple Stations (If Available): If more than one station exists, the HOA can designate one for strictly scheduled usage and the other for FCFS, or create slightly different booking rules to optimize turnover.  
   - Charge Priority System (Optional): Some HOAs assign priority to members who have fewer alternative charging options. This is a more advanced policy layer and must be administered carefully to remain equitable.

---

3. Additional Considerations

1. Fee Structure & Billing  
   - Per-kWh vs. Flat Fee: Ensure your chosen billing model incentivizes vehicles to vacate the space once charged. A per-kWh charge plus idle fee is often most equitable.  
   - Monthly Access Plans (Optional): Some communities offer unlimited or semi-unlimited charging for a fixed monthly fee, which can simplify administration but may reduce turnover if not balanced with time limits.

2. Enforcement & Penalties  
   - Monitoring: Physical checks or remote station data can identify violations (e.g., extended sessions, no-shows, or unauthorized occupancy).  
   - Fines and Warnings: Progressive penalty structures should be clearly posted, detailing first offense, second offense, etc.

3. Communication & Education  
   - Resident Orientation: Provide an initial onboarding session or guide so residents understand how to reserve time slots, the penalties for no-shows, and how FCFS reverts when windows go unused.  
   - Regular Updates: Send out periodic reminders or data on usage patterns to help residents schedule effectively.

4. Scalability  
   - As EV adoption increases, the HOA may decide to add additional charging stations, shorten or lengthen reserved blocks, or adjust FCFS hours. Tracking usage data (peak times, average dwell, waitlists, etc.) is vital for intelligent expansion.

4. Sample Schedule Summary

Below is a compact illustration of how the week might look:

- Monday – Friday (9:00 AM – 9:00 PM): FCFS.  
  - Maximum session = 3 hours  
  - Idle fee after completion  
  - Usage monitored but no formal reservations

- Monday – Friday (9:00 PM – 9:00 AM): Reserved windows.  
  - Two 4-hour windows:  
    1. 9:00 PM – 1:00 AM  
    2. 1:00 AM – 5:00 AM  
  - (Or adjust as needed, e.g., 9:00 PM – 12:00 AM / 12:00 AM – 3:00 AM / 3:00 AM – 6:00 AM / etc.)  
  - 25-minute grace period to claim a reservation, after which the station becomes FCFS.

- Saturday & Sunday (9:00 AM – 9:00 PM): Peak Weekend Reservation Blocks.  
  - Example: 2- or 3-hour segments across the day (9:00 AM – 12:00 PM, 12:00 PM – 3:00 PM, etc.).  
  - 15–20-minute grace period to start.  
  - Unclaimed or unreserved blocks revert to FCFS.

- Saturday & Sunday (9:00 PM – 9:00 AM): Same approach as weekday nights (reserved windows + FCFS fallback).
