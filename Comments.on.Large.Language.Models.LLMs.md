Machines can only interpret numbers. We collect these numbers into sets, called matrices or vectors (Linear Algebra) or arrays (Python), so that we can operate on the entirety of them, in for-loops. Tensors are parallel sets of for-loops. Linear algebra allows us to visualize for-loops. Calculus allows vectors and tensors (ie. our arrays), via a form of linear regression, such as gradient descent, to behave in a way that is meaningful when iterating through our arrays. Linear regression allows us to define functions. The more these numbers represent something meaningful, the more linear regression we have performed on these numbers. The goal is to find a meaningful way to represent information. Try to remember machines can only interpret numbers so we have to construct a representation onto these numbers and or the operations on these numbers and or the mathematical results that we get from the operations on these numbers or sets of numbers. That's language model engineering.
