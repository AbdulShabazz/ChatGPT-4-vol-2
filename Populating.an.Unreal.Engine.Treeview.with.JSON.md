**Q:** I need to populate an Unreal Engine treeview from a file. What is the most data-retrieval performant, reader friendly format for the file ?

**A:** When choosing a file format to populate an Unreal Engine treeview, it’s essential to balance performance with readability. Here’s a breakdown of the most suitable options:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

Pros:
 •	Readability: JSON is human-readable and easy to understand, making it straightforward for developers to edit and maintain.  
 •	Hierarchical Structure: It naturally supports nested structures, which aligns well with the treeview’s hierarchical nature.  
 •	Performance: Modern JSON parsers are highly optimized. Unreal Engine provides robust JSON handling through its Json and JsonUtilities modules, ensuring efficient parsing and data retrieval.  
 •	Wide Support: JSON is widely supported across various platforms and languages, making integration seamless.  

Cons:

 • Parsing Overhead: While JSON is fast, binary formats can be marginally quicker. However, the difference is often negligible for most applications.

Why JSON Over Other Formats?

 •	XML: While XML also supports hierarchical data, it’s more verbose and typically slower to parse compared to JSON. Additionally, JSON’s syntax is generally cleaner and easier to work with.  
 •	YAML: YAML is even more human-readable but lacks the same level of native support in Unreal Engine. It can also be more error-prone due to its reliance on indentation.  
 •	Binary Formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers, FlatBuffers): These offer superior performance but at the cost of human readability. They are best suited for scenarios where the data is not meant to be edited manually.  

Implementation Tips in Unreal Engine

 1.	Using Unreal’s JSON Libraries:  
 •	Utilize the FJsonSerializer and related classes provided by Unreal Engine to parse JSON files efficiently.  
 •	Structure your JSON to mirror the treeview’s hierarchy, ensuring a straightforward mapping from JSON objects to tree nodes.  
 2.	Optimizing Performance:  
 •	Asynchronous Loading: If the JSON file is large, consider loading and parsing it asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.  
 •	Caching: Cache the parsed data if it’s accessed frequently to minimize repeated parsing operations.  
 •	Validation: Implement error handling to manage malformed JSON data gracefully, ensuring the treeview remains robust.  
 3.	Example JSON Structure:  
 
```
{
  "Root": {
    "Child1": {
      "SubChild1": {},
      "SubChild2": {}
    },
    "Child2": {}
  }
}
```
This structure can be easily traversed to populate the treeview nodes accordingly.

Conclusion

JSON strikes the optimal balance between performance and readability for populating an Unreal Engine treeview. Its native support within Unreal Engine, combined with its hierarchical nature and ease of use, makes it the most suitable choice for your requirements.
