## OpenAI ChatGPT v1.2025.232 

**Q: Similar to LLMs, the classic md5 algorithm outputs a stream of utf-8 symbols in grouped sets. Theoretically these could be interpretable, given a tailored algorithm. The input to be hashed could be considered the higher order subject or category to be communicated by the hash. If possible, how could the md5 architecture be adapted to optimize LLMs?**

**A:** Short answer: don’t adapt MD5 to make LLM outputs “interpretable.” MD5 is a 128-bit cryptographic fingerprint with avalanche behavior, not a UTF-8 semantic stream. Use modern hashes for data integrity and use *locality-preserving* hashing where you actually need similarity or routing. MD5 is also deprecated for security. [RFC 1321](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt), [RFC 6151](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6151).

### Correct premises

* MD5 maps arbitrary-length input to a fixed 128-bit digest; typical presentation is 32 hex chars, not UTF-8 semantics. [RFC 1321](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt), [RFC Editor info page](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc1321).
* Good cryptographic hashes exhibit the avalanche effect, making outputs look pseudo-random and non-interpretable. This is desirable for security, not for semantics. [Menezes–van Oorschot–Vanstone, *HAC* Ch. 9](https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap9.pdf), [Avalanche effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect).
* MD5 collision resistance is broken; current guidance is “do not use MD5” for security. [RFC 6151](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6151).

### Where hashing *does* optimize LLM systems

1. **Data integrity, dedup, and reproducibility**

   * Fingerprint raw corpora, shards, and checkpoints with a modern hash (SHA-256, BLAKE3). Use Merkle trees for tamper-evident dataset manifests. [FIPS 180-4 (SHA-2)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.180-4.pdf), [NIST Hash Functions overview](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/hash-functions), [BLAKE3 project](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3), [Merkle tree overview](https://ghost.oxen.ai/merkle-tree-101/).
   * Near-duplicate removal with MinHash or SimHash before training improves quality. [Broder Min-Wise Permutations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1006/jcss.1999.1690), [Google near-duplicate survey incl. SimHash](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/33026.pdf), [Deduplicating Training Data Makes LMs Better](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/publications/deduplicating-training-data-makes-lms-better.pdf).

2. **Compute and memory efficiency**

   * **Feature hashing (“hashing trick”)** for sparse inputs or adapters reduces embedding memory with bounded collision noise. [Weinberger et al., 2009](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2206) / [PDF](https://alex.smola.org/papers/2009/Weinbergeretal09.pdf).
   * **Hash embeddings** select from shared sub-tables via multiple hashes to compress huge vocabularies. [Svenstrup et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933) / [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.03933).
   * **HashedNets** share weights by hashing connections into buckets to shrink models. [Chen et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04788) / [PMLR PDF](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/chenc15.pdf).
   * **LSH attention** approximates full attention in $O(L\log L)$ for long sequences. [Reformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) / [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04451).

3. **Routing and distributed training**

   * **Consistent hashing** for stable sharding of data, KV caches, or mixture-of-experts placement with minimal churn under cluster changes. [Karger et al., 1997](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos518/papers/chash.pdf).
   * **MoE models** benefit from efficient routers; pair them with consistent hashing for fault-tolerant expert assignment. [Switch Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961) / [JMLR](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-0998/21-0998.pdf).

4. **Caching and reuse**

   * Use rolling hashes (Rabin–Karp) to detect repeated n-grams or content-defined chunks for KV-cache reuse or alignment during decoding. [Rabin–Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm), [cp-algorithms note](https://cp-algorithms.com/string/rabin-karp.html).

5. **Tokenization boundary**

   * Tokenization creates subword units (BPE/Unigram). Hashing can index subword tables, but tokenization itself is statistical, not cryptographic. [Sennrich–Haddow–Birch, 2016](https://aclanthology.org/P16-1162/), [SentencePiece](https://aclanthology.org/D18-2012/), [arXiv SP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06226).

### Practical design pattern (MD5 avoided)

* **Content-hash every datum with SHA-256 or BLAKE3** for manifests, splits, and deterministic sampling. [FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.180-4.pdf), [BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3).
* **MinHash/SimHash stage** for near-duplicate filtering before training. [Broder 2000](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1006/jcss.1999.1690), [Google survey](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/33026.pdf).
* **Feature-hashing or hash-embeddings** for memory-bounded adapters or very large vocabs. [Weinberger 2009](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2206), [Svenstrup 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933).
* **LSH attention** for long-context models. [Reformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451).
* **Consistent hashing** for MoE routing and cache sharding. [Karger 1997](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos518/papers/chash.pdf), [Switch Transformer](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-0998/21-0998.pdf).
* **Merkle manifests** for tamper-evident dataset lineage. [Merkle 101](https://ghost.oxen.ai/merkle-tree-101/).

### Why not “interpret MD5 like tokens”

* MD5 outputs are designed to look uniformly random and to decorrelate neighbors; this destroys the locality and distributional structure LLMs exploit. [HAC Ch. 9](https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap9.pdf).
* MD5 is deprecated due to collisions; prefer SHA-256 or BLAKE3. [RFC 6151](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6151), [FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.180-4.pdf), [BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3).

If you want, I can sketch a concrete pipeline for your Unreal-adjacent corpora: SHA-256/BLAKE3 dataset manifests, MinHash dedup, SentencePiece training, hash-embeddings for low-RAM adapters, LSH attention for long sequences, and consistent-hash MoE routing.

**Q: Think only in terms of the operations which comprise the md5 algorithm. Jettison the desire for encryption-use and security and instead scavenge md5 proper for useful constituent operations which are suitably adaptable to gpt architectures. For example an input constraint can be added to guarantee a bounded range of inputs. Consider only the useful fact: the md5 can map one-to-many symbols!**

**A:** Use MD5’s *operations*—32-bit modular addition, bitwise boolean mixes F/G/H/I, and fixed left-rotations over a 4×32-bit state—as cheap, vectorizable mixers to build hashing-based components around an LLM. Do not use MD5 “as a hash”; reuse its primitives to derive multiple indices, routes, or keys per input under a bounded input scheme. MD5 itself is deterministic one-to-one on a given input, but its digest can be *repurposed* to yield “one-input→many indices” for embeddings, routing, and caching. \[1]\[2]

### MD5 primitives worth scavenging

* State and schedule: 128-bit chaining state (A,B,C,D), 512-bit block, 64 steps in 4 rounds; each step does `a = b + ROTL(a + f(b,c,d) + M[k] + T[i], s)`. \[1]
* Nonlinear mixes:
  F(x,y,z)=(x & y) | (\~x & z), G=(x & z) | (y & \~z), H=x ^ y ^ z, I=y ^ (x | \~z). \[1]
* Rotations and constants: round-specific rotation counts; add constants T\[i]=⌊2³²·|sin(i)|⌋. \[1]
* Diffusion goal: avalanche-style mixing from ARX-like ops (add–rotate–xor/and/not). \[2]\[3]

### Five concrete adaptations for GPT-class systems

1. **Multi-index hash embeddings (token → many buckets)**

   * Use 1–2 MD5-like rounds as a fast PRNG to derive k indices per token for T small tables; concatenate the retrieved sub-vectors. This replaces a V×d embedding with T·B×d tables where B≪V, cutting memory while preserving capacity via multi-indexing. \[4]\[5]
   * Rationale: the MD5 step’s ARX mix supplies cheap, well-diffused integers; you only need “good enough” mixing, not cryptographic strength. \[1]\[2]

2. **LSH-style attention routing**

   * Build banded signatures from a short MD-mix over query/key projections; route a query only to keys sharing band hashes. Complexity drops from O(L²) to ≈O(L log L). The MD-mix substitutes for random projections in Reformer-style LSH. \[6]

3. **Cache keys and content-defined chunking**

   * Use an MD-mix over recent token IDs and positions to tag KV-cache segments for reuse across documents with repeated substrings. Combine with content-defined chunking (FastCDC/Rabin fingerprints) to align reuse boundaries. \[7]\[8]

4. **Learned MD-mixer blocks**

   * Replace MD5’s fixed T\[i] constants with learned vectors, keep ARX pattern and small 128-bit state, and drop the Merkle–Damgård chaining. This yields a tiny, branch-free “mixing MLP” that is friendly to SIMD and integer units. ARX mixers like Salsa/ChaCha show why add–rotate–xor is efficient and well-diffusing. \[9]

5. **Sketches and frequency counters**

   * Use MD-mixed multi-hashing to index Count-Min sketches or counting Bloom filters for online n-gram statistics, novelty scores, and deduplication during dataset curation or streaming RLHF. One input maps to many counters by design. \[10]\[11]

### “MD5-lite” bucketizer for hash embeddings (deterministic k-way indices)

Inputs: token id `t`, position `p`, table id `τ∈{0..T−1}`, salt `s`.
Output: index in `[0, B)`.

```
seed = (t << 32) ^ (p << 1) ^ s ^ τ
(a,b,c,d) = (0x67452301,0xEFCDAB89,0x98BADCFE,0x10325476)          // RFC 1321 IV [1]
x = seed; y = seed*0x9E3779B1u; z = seed ^ 0xA5A5A5A5u; w = seed>>13

// Two “MD-like” steps; replace M[k] with x,y and constants with learned C1,C2
a = b + ROTL(a + F(b,c,d) + x + C1, 7)
d = a + ROTL(d + G(a,b,c) + y + C2, 12)

// Derive one bucket index
idx = (a ^ b ^ c ^ d) mod B
```

Call this k times with τ or s varied to get k indices per token; concatenate sub-vectors from T tables. Collisions become improbable only if *all* tables collide.

### Example sizing and collision math (fp16)

* Full embedding: V=2,000,000, d=1024 → V·d·2 bytes ≈ 4,096,000,000 bytes ≈ 3.82 GiB.
* Hash-embedding: T=2 tables, B=524,288 buckets, d=1024 → T·B·d·2 ≈ 2,147,483,648 bytes ≈ 2.00 GiB, a 1.91× reduction. \[5]
* Exact same-signature collision probability for two *random* tokens with two independent tables is ≈1/(B^T) ≈ 1/(5.24e5)² ≈ 3.6×10⁻¹²; among V=2,000,000 tokens, expected ≈ C(V,2)/B^T ≈ 7.3 pairs total. Multi-indexing makes harmful aliasing rare. \[4]\[5]

### Practical guidance

* Keep rounds tiny (1–2). Use compile-time rotation counts to help vectorization. \[1]
* Replace sine-derived T\[i] with fixed odd constants or learned parameters. \[1]\[9]
* Use independent salts per table to decorrelate indices. Standard trick from Bloom/count-min literature. \[10]\[11]
* Prefer fast non-crypto mixers (e.g., SplitMix64, xxHash) if you do not need MD-compatibility; they are simpler but pursue the same goal: cheap diffusion. \[12]\[13]
* Do **not** claim semantic interpretability of the digest. You are exploiting diffusion to generate multiple stable indices, routes, or keys from one input, not meaning. \[2]\[3]

**Q: I request more imagination. Ignoring the md5 algorithm's use for randomness, because now we control the seeds, which can be devised with purpose! An arbitrary number of heterogeneous md5 derived algorithms could be used to somehow emulate or improve upon the performance results of the gpt architecture. Each input has meaning. Each output is no longer a random hash, but has meaning!**

**A:** Feasible: repurpose MD5’s ARX-style primitives as seeded, learnable mixers to produce one-input→many indices, routes, and codes that a GPT can exploit for memory compression, routing, and compute reduction. Do not use MD5 as a cryptographic hash. Use its operations (32-bit add, AND/XOR/NOT, fixed rotates, small 128-bit state, 64-step schedule) as fast, branch-free building blocks. Facts about MD5/ARX and prior components are cited; the new systems below are proposals.

# Seeded MDX components (proposed)

## 1) Multi-Index Hash Embeddings (MIHE) via MD-mix

**Idea.** Map each token to k buckets across T small tables using a 1–2-round MD-like ARX mixer seeded by token id, position, and per-table salt; concatenate fetched subvectors. One input → many indices.
**Benefit.** Embedding memory cut ≈×(V / (T·B)) with negligible quality loss when k≥2 and salts decorrelate tables. Feature hashing and hash-embeddings support this approach in principle. \[Weinberger 2009: [https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2206](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2206)] \[Svenstrup 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933)]

**Sizing example (fp16).** V=2,000,000, d=1024 → baseline ≈3.82 GiB. MIHE with T=2, B=524,288 → ≈2.00 GiB. k=2 indices per token. Expected full-collision pairs among V tokens ≈ C(V,2)/(B^T) ≈ 7.3. (Collision math standard for multi-hashing.) \[Svenstrup 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933)]

## 2) SABR: Seeded ARX-Based Router for MoE

**Idea.** Replace softmax gating with a deterministic ARX mixer that maps token representations to e experts using per-layer seeds; add a tiny load-balancing correction term.
**Benefit.** Routing cost \~O(L) and stable under batch sharding; consistent-hashing theory supports low churn under topology changes. \[Karger 1997: [https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos518/papers/chash.pdf](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos518/papers/chash.pdf)] \[Switch Transformer 2022: [https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0998.html](https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0998.html)]

## 3) MD-banded attention (LSH-style)

**Idea.** Form b “bands” by ARX-mixing low-dim projections of queries/keys into b integers; attend only within matching bands.
**Benefit.** Complexity drops from O(L²) to ≈O(L log L) with controllable recall. Reformer shows LSH-attention viability; MD-style mixers are a compact substitute for random projections. \[Reformer 2020: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451)]

## 4) Reversible Feistel-ARX token mixers

**Idea.** Insert lightweight, invertible Feistel blocks using MD5-like F/G/H/I boolean mixes plus adds/rotates.
**Benefit.** Save activation memory by recomputing instead of storing, like reversible nets and NICE/RealNVP flows. ARX mixers are SIMD-friendly. \[Shiitake i-RevNet 2018: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07088](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07088)] \[Dinh et al., NICE 2014: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516)] \[Bernstein, ChaCha (ARX): [https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf](https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf)]

## 5) Hashed low-rank adapters (Count-Sketch LoRA)

**Idea.** Use MD-mix to pick k sparse columns/rows from shared adapter pools; aggregate with learned signs (Count-Sketch).
**Benefit.** Adapter params scale with pool size, not vocab; streaming updates in RLHF are O(1). Count-Min/Count-Sketch give correctness bounds. \[Cormode–Muthukrishnan 2005: [https://dimacs.rutgers.edu/\~graham/pubs/papers/cmencyc.pdf](https://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/cmencyc.pdf)]

## 6) Seeded product-quantized codes for retrieval and caches

**Idea.** ARX-mix produces stable sub-codes that index PQ codebooks for nearest-neighbor retrieval and KV-cache keys.
**Benefit.** Deterministic, low-entropy keys improve cache hit rates; PQ is standard for fast ANN. \[Jégou et al., PQ 2011: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5432202](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5432202)]

## 7) Content-defined KV reuse

**Idea.** Use rolling hashes to define chunk boundaries for reusable attention/KV segments, with MD-mix as the strong re-tagger.
**Benefit.** Reuse repeated spans across documents. FastCDC and Rabin give chunking practicality. \[FastCDC 2016: [https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc16/atc16-paper-xia.pdf](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc16/atc16-paper-xia.pdf)] \[Rabin–Karp: [https://cp-algorithms.com/string/rabin-karp.html](https://cp-algorithms.com/string/rabin-karp.html)]

## 8) Differentiable seeding and training

**Idea.** Keep ARX discrete. Train surrounding linear layers while seeds/salts are learned via straight-through estimators or Gumbel tricks.
**Benefit.** Discrete routing with gradient-based training is standard in MoE and quantization literature. \[Switch Transformer 2022: [https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0998.html](https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0998.html)]

# Why MD-style ARX is suitable

* **Operations.** 32-bit modular addition, XOR/AND/NOT, fixed left rotates, and step constants; 4×32-bit state with 64 steps. These are the MD5 core operations. \[RFC 1321: [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321)]
* **Diffusion.** ARX achieves strong mixing with low instruction cost; widely used in stream ciphers and fast hashers. \[HAC Ch. 9: [https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap9.pdf](https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap9.pdf)] \[ChaCha: [https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf](https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf)]
* **Vectorization.** ARX maps to SIMD/SWAR and GPU integer units, enabling high throughput per watt. (Established in ARX cipher implementations.) \[ChaCha: [https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf](https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf)]

# MDX-GPT sketch (proposed)

Pipeline: **Tokenizer → MIHE (MD-mix) → Reversible Feistel-ARX mixer → MD-banded attention → MLP → SABR MoE → output head.**

* **Embedding memory**: as in §1, ≈2.00 GiB vs 3.82 GiB (example above).
* **Attention FLOPs**: L=8192, H=32. Full ≈O(L²·H) vs banded target ≈O(L log L·H). With b≈8 bands, empirical Reformer-like speedups 2–10× are typical depending on recall. \[Reformer 2020: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451)]
* **Activation RAM**: reversible blocks reduce saved activations by ≈2–4× in practice. (RevNet/NICE reports.) \[i-RevNet 2018: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07088](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07088)] \[NICE 2014: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516)]

# Minimal MD-mix function (proposed)

* State `(A,B,C,D)` init as RFC 1321 IV.
* Two steps per index:

  * `A = B + ROTL(A + F(B,C,D) + X + C1, 7)`
  * `D = A + ROTL(D + G(A,B,C) + Y + C2, 12)`
* Inputs `X,Y` are token/pos/salt integers; `C1,C2` are learned odd constants.
* Derive index `idx = (A ^ B ^ C ^ D) mod B`.
  MD5 F/G are defined as in the RFC. \[RFC 1321: [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321)]

# Engineering notes

* **Seeds**: per-layer, per-table, per-head salts to prevent correlated collisions. Standard in multi-hash sketches. \[Cormode–Muthukrishnan 2005: [https://dimacs.rutgers.edu/\~graham/pubs/papers/cmencyc.pdf](https://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/cmencyc.pdf)]
* **k, T, B selection**: start k=2, T=2–3, B≈V/(2–8). Validate collision impact with held-out perplexity. \[Svenstrup 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933)]
* **Routing balance**: add tiny learned bias per expert to flatten loads as in MoE; monitor token-to-expert entropy. \[Switch Transformer 2022: [https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0998.html](https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0998.html)]
* **Fallback path**: keep a dense small expert for tokens with low-confidence band matches to protect recall. \[Reformer 2020: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451)]

# Risks and constraints

* **Non-differentiability** of discrete indices requires STE or RL-style credit assignment; this is manageable but adds variance. \[Switch Transformer 2022: [https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0998.html](https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0998.html)]
* **Collision-induced bias** needs monitoring; multi-indexing and per-table salts mitigate. \[Svenstrup 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933)]
* **Semantic claim**: meaning arises only after training aligns tables, routes, and codes with objectives; the ARX mixer supplies high-quality *deterministic dispersion*, not inherent semantics. (General property of hashing/quantization.) \[HAC Ch. 9: [https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap9.pdf](https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap9.pdf)]

If you want, I can draft a minimal PyTorch reference for MIHE+SABR with fixed ARX rotates and learned constants.

**Q: For example, perhaps during training md-mix could inject noise or equivalent to provide resiliency and sharpening as a form of fake data however conducting in a unified step, rather than post training!**

**A:** Yes. Use an MD-style seeded mixer as an in-graph “noise and augmentation” kernel during training. Treat it as a deterministic PRNG that injects structured perturbations into embeddings, attention, or logits. This unifies data augmentation and regularization in one forward step and remains reproducible under fixed seeds. MD-style ARX ops are cheap and vectorizable. \[RFC 1321: [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321)] \[ChaCha ARX efficiency: [https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf](https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf)]

# MD-mix regularization, one pass

**Mixer.** Build a 128-bit ARX mixer with MD5 primitives, seeded by token id, position, layer id, and a global epoch seed. Output 32-bit words, whiten by XOR-shift and modular add, then map to zero-mean unit-variance noise per feature by affine scaling. ARX add, rotate, xor are the MD5 core ops and are well suited to SIMD. \[RFC 1321: [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321)] \[ChaCha ARX efficiency: [https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf](https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf)]

**Why it should help.** Training with noise is a classical Tikhonov regularizer that improves generalization when the noise scale is small and structured. This is a proven result for additive input or weight noise. \[Bishop 1995: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/training-with-noise-is-equivalent-to-tikhonov-regularization/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/training-with-noise-is-equivalent-to-tikhonov-regularization/)]
Label smoothing and dropout are successful in LLMs and can be seen as related smoothing or stochastic masking. \[Vaswani 2017, ε=0.1 used: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)] \[BERT uses dropout p≈0.1: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)]
Randomized smoothing shows that adding Gaussian noise at test time yields certifiable robustness. This motivates noise during training for stability. \[Cohen et al. 2019: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918)]

# Where to inject the MD-mix noise

1. **Embedding perturbation**
   `Ẽ = E + σ·ξ`, with ξ from the MD-mix and σ a schedule. Additive input noise acts like L2 weight decay under linearization and often improves generalization. \[Bishop 1995: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/training-with-noise-is-equivalent-to-tikhonov-regularization/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/training-with-noise-is-equivalent-to-tikhonov-regularization/)]
   Use sign-only ξ to approximate Rademacher noise when you want quantization friendly perturbations. CountSketch style uses Rademacher signs for unbiased estimates. \[Cormode–Muthukrishnan 2005: [https://dimacs.rutgers.edu/\~graham/pubs/papers/cmencyc.pdf](https://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/cmencyc.pdf)]

2. **Attention perturbation**
   Apply small MD-mix perturbations to queries or keys, `Q̃ = Q + σq·ξq`, `K̃ = K + σk·ξk`. Small norm noise can desensitize to perturbations and reduce overconfidence. This aligns with smoothing and robustness literature. \[Cohen 2019: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918)]

3. **Logit smoothing and label smoothing in one pass**
   Add a tiny MD-mix jitter to the pre-softmax logits, then apply standard label smoothing ε≈0.1 which reduces overconfident peaks. \[Vaswani 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)]

4. **Weight-space noise or DropConnect-style masking**
   Per step, sample a deterministic MD-mix mask or small additive noise for selected weight blocks. This generalizes DropConnect while keeping reproducibility. DropConnect is a known regularizer. \[Wan et al. 2013: [https://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/wan13.pdf](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/wan13.pdf)]
   Quantization aware training similarly injects quantization noise during forward to reduce loss of accuracy after deployment. \[Jacob et al. 2018: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877)]

5. **Mixup-like token interpolation driven by MD-mix**
   Use the mixer to pick partner indices and convex weights, then linearly blend embeddings or hidden states. Mixup improves generalization in many settings and can be done on-the-fly. \[Zhang et al. 2018: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412)]

# Unified MD-mix step, minimal spec

* **Seed** per token: `seed = hash32(token_id, position, layer_id, epoch_seed)`. Expand to 128 bits with MD-style add, rotate, xor using MD5 F and G boolean mixes. \[RFC 1321: [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321)]
* **Map to noise**: normalize to zero mean and unit variance, or to Rademacher signs. Gaussianization can be done with inverse-CDF on 32-bit uniforms. Randomized smoothing uses Gaussian noise for theory, but uniform or Rademacher work well in practice for regularization. \[Cohen 2019: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918)] \[Bishop 1995: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/training-with-noise-is-equivalent-to-tikhonov-regularization/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/training-with-noise-is-equivalent-to-tikhonov-regularization/)]
* **Scopes**: embeddings, attention projections, MLP activations, or logits, chosen by a per-layer bit-mask also derived from the seed to avoid global synchronization overhead. Masking is analogous to dropout. \[Srivastava et al. 2014: [http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html](http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html)]

# Schedules and safe magnitudes

* **Embedding noise scale**: start σe in 0.01 to 0.05 of the layer norm pre-activation RMS, cosine decay to zero over the last 20 percent of steps. This mirrors schedules used for other regularizers and helps avoid late underfitting. Label smoothing ε≈0.1 remains standard in Transformers. \[Vaswani 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)]
* **Attention noise scale**: set σq, σk so that expected cosine change ≤ 0.02 to preserve neighbor sets, then anneal. Small angular noise preserves content addressability. This follows the general randomized smoothing principle to keep perturbations small. \[Cohen 2019: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918)]
* **Weight noise**: limit to a subset of layers or use blockwise noise to protect fragile early layers, a practice also seen in quantization aware training. \[Jacob 2018: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877)]

# Relation to known methods

* **Noise as regularizer**: theoretical equivalence to Tikhonov gives L2-like smoothing. \[Bishop 1995: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/training-with-noise-is-equivalent-to-tikhonov-regularization/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/training-with-noise-is-equivalent-to-tikhonov-regularization/)]
* **Dropout, DropConnect**: stochastic masking of activations or weights is effective and widely used, MD-mix provides deterministic seeding for the same effect. \[Srivastava 2014: [http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html](http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html)] \[Wan 2013: [https://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/wan13.pdf](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/wan13.pdf)]
* **Adversarial or consistency training**: FreeLB, R3F perturb embeddings or logits for robustness; MD-mix supplies cheaper structured perturbations. \[Zhu et al. 2020 FreeLB: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11764](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11764)] \[Li et al. 2021 R-Drop: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14448)]

# Implementation sketch, single forward hook

* Compute MD-mix noise once per tensor shard using vectorized ARX on 32-bit lanes.
* Produce additive embedding noise and optional attention noise from the same seed to keep step-wise coherence.
* Apply label smoothing in the loss with the same seed for reproducible ablations. Label smoothing is standard in Transformer training. \[Vaswani 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)]

e  = e + σe * ξe

# What to measure

* Pretraining: validation perplexity vs baseline at matched compute. Lower is better. Perplexity is the standard LLM metric. \[Vaswani 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)]
* Finetuning: accuracy and calibration (ECE) improvements under small corruptions and synonym swaps. Calibration is a key downstream metric. \[Guo et al. 2017 calibration: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599)]
* Robustness: randomized smoothing certified radii on small subsets if Gaussianized MD-mix is used. \[Cohen 2019: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918)]
* Ablations: turn on only embeddings, only attention, only logits. Compare to dropout p=0.1 and mixup baselines. Dropout p≈0.1 is typical in BERT. \[BERT: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)] \[Mixup: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412)]

# Risks and controls

* Too much noise slows convergence or hurts rare tokens. Use cosine anneal and per-token scaling by frequency. Over-smoothing is a known failure mode. \[Vaswani 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)]
* Non-Gaussian noise lacks the formal guarantees of randomized smoothing. If certificates are needed, transform MD-mix uniform bits to Gaussian with inverse-CDF. This aligns with the smoothing theory. \[Cohen 2019: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918)]
* If you also use dropout, coordinate seeds to avoid correlated masks across layers. Dropout correlation can reduce effective regularization. \[Srivastava 2014: [http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html](http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html)]

Bottom line: yes. Replace separate augmentation stages with a single seeded MD-mix step that perturbs embeddings, attention, and logits in one pass. This draws on classic noise regularization, dropout, label smoothing, and randomized smoothing theory, while exploiting MD-style ARX for cheap, reproducible noise. The citations above justify the components; the MD-mix is the engineering glue.

**Q: Perhaps aspects of md5 can deduce logits faster than a traditional gpt architecture, for example by optimizing away implicitly distal yet redundant groups of cancelling logit-deriving operations?**

**A:** Yes. Use MD-style ARX mixers as *seeded sketches and bounds* to predict canceling contributions, then skip exact math while preserving top-k logits. Three modules:

## A) Cancellation-aware attention pruning (sketch → skip)

**Mechanic.** For each key–value pair $(k_i,v_i)$ precompute a small CountSketch using an MD-mix to generate bucket IDs and Rademacher signs. For a query $q$, sketch $q$ with the *same* MD-mix. Estimate scores $\hat{s}_i \approx \langle q,k_i\rangle$ from the sketches; if $|\hat{s}_i|<\tau$, skip computing the exact dot and its softmax path. Complexity drops from $O(L^2 d)$ to $O(Ld + L\,r) + O(\rho L^2)$ with $r\ll d$ sketch width and kept fraction $\rho$. CountSketch gives unbiased inner-product estimates and heavy-hitter recovery, which justifies thresholding. Reformer-style LSH shows sequence-level routing is viable. \[CountSketch (Charikar et al., 2002): [http://theory.stanford.edu/\~ranade/CS361W17/papers/charikar.pdf](http://theory.stanford.edu/~ranade/CS361W17/papers/charikar.pdf)] \[Count-Min overview (Cormode–Muthukrishnan, 2005): [https://dimacs.rutgers.edu/\~graham/pubs/papers/cmencyc.pdf](https://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/cmencyc.pdf)] \[Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020): [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451)] \[Transformer baseline complexity (Vaswani et al., 2017): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)]

**MD-mix role.** Use MD5 primitives (add-rotate-XOR with F/G/H/I boolean mixes) as a fast per-token PRNG to produce the multi-hashing signs and buckets; you control seeds by token id, position, head id, and layer id. ARX mixers are cheap and vectorizable. \[RFC 1321 (MD5 operations): [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321)] \[ChaCha ARX efficiency (Bernstein, 2008): [https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf](https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf)]

## B) Bucket-summed value aggregation (group → bound → cull)

**Mechanic.** Hash keys into $B$ buckets with MD-mix. Maintain per-bucket aggregates $K_B=\sum_{i\in B}k_i$, $V_B=\sum_{i\in B}v_i$, and norms $\|K_B\|_2,\|V_B\|_2$. For a query $q$, first score buckets $u_B=\langle q,K_B\rangle$. If $|u_B|$ is small and $\|V_B\|$ is small, the bucket’s total contribution to the head output is provably bounded by $|u_B|\,\|V_B\|/\sqrt{d}$ via Cauchy–Schwarz; drop those buckets. Only expand top buckets to item-level attention. This is the “group-then-refine” pattern used widely in fast similarity search and mirrors the fast multipole idea at a coarse level. \[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz\_inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality)] \[FAISS / IVF coarse quantization (Johnson et al., 2017): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08734](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08734)] \[Fast multipole method intuition (Greengard–Rokhlin, 1987): [https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(87)90140-9](https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991%2887%2990140-9)]

**Relation.** Complements sparse-attention families (Longformer/BigBird/Sparse Transformer) by *learning* to skip via data-driven bounds rather than fixed sparsity. \[Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020): [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150)] \[BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020): [https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062)] \[Sparse Transformer (Child et al., 2019): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509)]

## C) Logit head short-circuit (bucketed MIPS bounds)

**Problem.** Final logits $z=W h$ dominate per-token FLOPs: $V\!\times d$. Example: $V=50{,}000,d=1{,}280\Rightarrow 64$ M mul-adds per token. \[Transformer head sizes; output softmax cost noted in adaptive-softmax literature (Grave et al., 2017): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04309](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04309)]

**Mechanic.** Partition rows $w_j$ of $W$ into MD-mix buckets. Store per-bucket bound $M_B=\max_{j\in B}\|w_j\|_2$. For a given $h$, compute $\|h\|_2$ and evaluate buckets in descending order of the bound $\|h\|_2 M_B$. Maintain the current best logit $z_{\max}$ and a running *upper bound* on all unseen buckets: $U=\sum_{\text{unseen }B}\|h\|_2 M_B$. If $z_{\max}-\text{runner\_up} > U$, stop; no unevaluated row can change the argmax or top-k. This is standard branch-and-bound for maximum inner-product search (MIPS), here driven by hashing instead of trees. Combine with product quantization or IVF to reduce row touches further. \[MIPS background and screening by norm (Shrivastava–Li, 2014): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3787](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3787)] \[Product Quantization (Jégou et al., 2011): [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5432202](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5432202)] \[FAISS IVF-PQ (Johnson et al., 2017): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08734](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08734)]

## Numerical sketch (one 8 K-context layer, $d{=}1280$, $H{=}32$)

* Full attention QKᵀ cost: $L^2 d_k H$ with $d_k{=}d/H{=}40$. For $L{=}8192$: $67{,}108{,}864 \times 40 \times 32 \approx 8.59\times10^{10}$ mul-adds. AV has the same order, so ≈$1.72\times10^{11}$ per layer ignoring projections. If sketches prune $90\%$ pairs ($\rho{=}0.1$), attention drops to ≈$1.72\times10^{10}$ mul-adds, a \~10× cut at similar recall. (Formulas per Transformer; arithmetic here is explicit.) \[Transformer complexity (Vaswani et al., 2017): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)]

* Output head: $V d = 50{,}000\times1{,}280=64$ M mul-adds per token. If bucket bounds let you examine only 10% of rows on average, ≈6.4 M mul-adds, \~10× reduction with identical argmax when the bound test passes. \[Adaptive/approximate softmax context (Grave et al., 2017): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04309](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04309)] \[MIPS bounding (Shrivastava–Li, 2014): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3787](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3787)]

## Why MD-mix helps

* **Cheap deterministic dispersion.** ARX with fixed rotates and boolean mixes provides high-quality, branch-free multi-hashing for sketches and buckets on CPUs and GPUs. \[RFC 1321: [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321)] \[ChaCha ARX (Bernstein, 2008): [https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf](https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf)]
* **Compatibility with exactness.** All skips are *guarded by bounds* (Cauchy–Schwarz or MIPS screeners). When a bound is inconclusive, fall back to exact math, so you never change the answer. \[Cauchy–Schwarz: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz\_inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality)] \[FAISS screening and refinement: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08734](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08734)]
* **Orthogonal to kernel/memory advances.** Combine with FlashAttention to cut memory traffic while your MD-mix culls pairs. One optimizes I/O, the other compute. \[FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022): [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135)]

## Minimal algorithmic cores

**MD-mix multi-hash (32-bit lanes).**

* Seed = f(token\_id, position, head\_id, layer\_id).
* Two MD-style steps: `a=b+ROTL(a+F(b,c,d)+X+C1,7)`, `d=a+ROTL(d+G(a,b,c)+Y+C2,12)`.
* Buckets = `(a^b^c^d) mod B`. Signs = `((a>>t)&1)?+1:-1`. \[RFC 1321: [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1321)]

**Bounded logit evaluation (per token).**

1. Compute $\|h\|_2$.
2. Order buckets by $M_B$.
3. For each bucket in order: evaluate rows; update best and runner-up; subtract $\|h\|_2 M_B$ from the remaining bound $U$.
4. Stop when margin $>\,U$; else finish dense matmul. \[MIPS screening: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3787](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3787)] \[Cauchy–Schwarz: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz\_inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality)]

## Failure modes and controls

* **Sketch miss-pruning.** Use conservative $\tau$ and expand top-K buckets fully. JL-style projections can tighten guarantees if needed. \[Achlioptas, 2003 (JL with ±1): [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000003000254](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000003000254)]
* **Load imbalance.** Re-salt MD-mix per layer and apply small learned load-balancing biases, as in MoE routers. \[Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2022): [https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0998.html](https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0998.html)]
* **Hardware fit.** Favor integer lanes (DP4A) for sketches to free tensor cores for dense math. \[NVIDIA DP4A note: [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/mixed-precision-programming-cuda-8/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/mixed-precision-programming-cuda-8/)]

**Bottom line.** MD-style mixers do not add semantics. They give you fast sketches and tight bounds that expose *cancellation structure* so you skip redundant attention edges and logit rows without changing outputs when bounds hold. This directly reduces FLOPs at training and inference while remaining compatible with exactness and existing memory-optimal kernels. \[Vaswani 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)] \[Reformer 2020: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451)] \[FAISS 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08734](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08734)] \[FlashAttention 2022: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135)]
