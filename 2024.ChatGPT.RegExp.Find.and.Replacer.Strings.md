# ChatGPT RegExp find/replacer strings

As of 04-NOV-2024 ChatGPT no longer generates matching **Markdown** for all of its answers, so they must be copied/pasted and **reformatted**, accordingly: 

```
// Expression

From:
	â€¢\t

To:
*\t
```
```
// Expression

From:
^(\d+\.?)(\s*)([\w\s]+:?)$

To:
$1$2**$3**
```
```
// Expression

From:
^[\t\s]*(\d+)

To:
$1
```
```
// Expression

From:
	(\d+).	([\s\w\-]+):

To:
	$1.	**$2**:
```
```
// Expression

From:
\*	([\w\-\s]+)?:

To:
*	**$1**:
```
```
// Expression

From:
\n(\w[\w\w:]+)$\n\n

To:
\n**$1**\n\n
```
```
// Expression
