**Q:** Can Unreal Engine blend space animations be cached to create replayable animations which support anim notifies for robust game state management?

**A:** Unreal Engine blend spaces are primarily designed for real‐time animation blending rather than for creating pre‐recorded, replayable animation sequences with integrated timeline events such as anim notifies. The standard caching techniques available in animation blueprints—most notably the Cache Pose node—are intended solely for performance optimization by storing the computed skeletal pose for reuse during the same frame or across a few frames. They do not encapsulate the time-based progression necessary to trigger anim notifies.

Below is a detailed explanation and comparative overview:

• **Blend Space Fundamentals**  
  - Blend spaces dynamically blend multiple animation inputs based on runtime parameters (e.g., speed, direction).  
  - They are evaluated each frame to compute a skeletal pose, meaning their output is inherently transient and parameter-driven.

• **Caching via Animation Blueprint Nodes**  
  - **Cache Pose Node:**  
    - Purpose: Stores the current pose output from a complex animation node for performance reuse.  
    - Limitation: This cache contains only the current bone transform data without any timeline context; hence, it does not support triggering anim notifies.
  - **Use Cached Pose Node:**  
    - Purpose: Reapplies the cached pose to avoid re-computation within the same frame.  
    - Limitation: It does not replay the animation sequence over time; it merely reuses a snapshot pose.

• **Anim Notifies and Timeline Requirements**  
  - Anim notifies are key events placed on the timeline of an Animation Sequence or Montage.  
  - These notifies require a defined, time-ordered progression of keyframes, which is not provided by the real-time evaluation and caching mechanism inherent to blend spaces.

• **Alternative Approach for Replayable Animations**  
  To achieve replayable animations from blend spaces that support anim notifies for robust game state management, consider recording the blend space output into an Animation Sequence or Montage. This conversion process involves:
  - **Recording the Blend Space Output:**  
    - Using Unreal Engine’s Take Recorder or a custom recording system, capture the blend space evaluation over time.  
    - The recorded asset will have a fixed timeline (e.g., 60 frames per second) where each frame’s bone transforms are stored.
  - **Embedding Anim Notifies:**  
    - Once recorded, you can insert anim notifies into the Animation Sequence timeline.  
    - These notifies will then fire at the specified frames during playback, ensuring robust state management.

• **Blueprint Flow Illustrations**

  **Flow 1: Real-Time Blend Space Evaluation (Caching for Performance Only)**  
  ```
  Evaluate Blend Space Node
      Parameters: Speed, Direction, etc.
          └── Cache Pose Node ("CachedBlendSpacePose")
                  └── Use Cached Pose Node
                          └── Output Pose
  ```
  - *Note:* This flow is effective for runtime performance optimization but does not create a replayable timeline or trigger anim notifies.

  **Flow 2: Recording a Replayable Animation from a Blend Space**  
  ```
  On Event: Begin Recording (e.g., Input Event)
      └── Take Recorder Start Node
              Settings:
                  • Target: Blend Space Output
                  • Frame Rate: 60 fps
                  
  Evaluate Blend Space Node
      Parameters: Speed, Direction, etc.
          └── Capture Pose Node (Recording each frame)
  
  On Event: End Recording
      └── Take Recorder Stop Node
              └── Create Animation Sequence Asset ("RecordedBlendSpaceAnim")
  
  Playback Process:
      └── Play Animation Sequence Node ("RecordedBlendSpaceAnim")
              └── Anim Notifies Trigger as per Timeline
  ```
  - *Details:*  
    - **Take Recorder:** Captures the blend space output over a fixed duration, generating an Animation Sequence with a defined timeline.  
    - **Frame Rate Consideration:** A higher frame rate (e.g., 60 fps) ensures smoother capture and precise timing for anim notifies.  
    - **Playback Node:** Once recorded, the Animation Sequence can be played back normally, with anim notifies executing at the predetermined frames.

• **Summary and Recommendations**  
  - **Direct Caching:** Using Cache Pose and related nodes does not support anim notifies since they lack a temporal sequence.  
  - **Recording for Replayability:** To create a replayable animation with anim notifies, record the blend space output into an Animation Sequence. This method ensures that both the animation data and timeline-based events are preserved.  
  - **Use Case Considerations:**  
    - For performance-sensitive real-time blending, use caching nodes.  
    - For cutscenes or game state transitions where consistent replay and event triggering are essential, rely on recorded Animation Sequences or Montages.

In conclusion, while blend space caching in Unreal Engine serves to optimize runtime performance, it is not designed to create replayable animations that inherently support anim notifies. For robust game state management requiring precise event triggering, it is advisable to record the blend space output into a proper animation asset using the Take Recorder system or a similar recording approach.
