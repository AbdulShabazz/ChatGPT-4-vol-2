**Q: What is the name of the usps postal note delivery drivers leave for missed packages?**

**A:** The slip is called **PS Form 3849 – “We ReDeliver for You!”**

USPS refers to it as a **“Delivery Notice/Reminder/Receipt”**. It’s the orange/peach-colored notice carriers leave when:

* a package requires a signature and no one is available, or
* the item is too large / otherwise can’t be left.

So if you’re searching online or asking at the post office, mention **“PS Form 3849 delivery notice”**.
