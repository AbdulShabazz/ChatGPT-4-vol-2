**Q:** Are scabs and fingernails composed of the same cells ?

**A:** No, scabs and fingernails are composed of different types of cells and structures, though both are part of the bodyâ€™s protective mechanisms.

1. **Scabs**:
   - **Primary composition**: Scabs are made up primarily of **blood clot** components, such as fibrin, platelets, and dried blood.
   - **Function**: Scabs form to protect a wound from infection, stop bleeding, and allow the underlying skin to heal.
   - **Cellular makeup**: The cells involved in scab formation are mainly **blood cells** like **platelets** (which initiate clotting) and **red blood cells** (trapped in the clot). Additionally, white blood cells are present to fight infection.

2. **Fingernails**:
   - **Primary composition**: Fingernails are made up of **keratin**, a type of protein that forms a tough, protective structure.
   - **Function**: Fingernails protect the tips of fingers and toes and aid in picking up objects and providing dexterity.
   - **Cellular makeup**: The cells in fingernails are specialized **keratinocytes**, which produce and become embedded in keratin as they die and harden, forming the nail plate.

Thus, scabs and fingernails are made of different cellular components: **blood-derived cells** in the case of scabs, and **keratin-producing epithelial cells** for fingernails.
