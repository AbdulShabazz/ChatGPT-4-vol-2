**Q:** As the number of tokens an LLM can process increases, rather than iterate over the entirety of them to find the next token with the highest probability of occuring -- and since the probability for each token has also been normalized -- has anyone considerered creating a dictionary or hash lookup table of all of the probabilities between 0 and 1, then inserting each token at it corresponding probability and finally iterating through the table from 1.00 down to 0.00 to find the next token as a means to improve performance ?

**A:** The method you describe suggests an approach where the probability space of token predictions is mapped to a sorted data structure, such as a dictionary or a hash table, with tokens indexed by their corresponding probability values. This would then allow an algorithm to directly traverse the space from 1.00 down to 0.00 (or vice versa) in search of the most probable token.

Here are some key considerations for this approach:

### 1. **Efficiency of the Hash Table for Probability Range:**
   - Hash tables are typically optimized for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions, based on key uniqueness and distribution. In the scenario of normalized probabilities, you would need to decide how to discretize the continuous probability range (0 to 1) into meaningful bins.
   - A challenge is that the distribution of token probabilities is rarely uniform. In most cases, many tokens have probabilities near zero, with a few candidates having higher probabilities. Creating hash buckets for such a range might introduce uneven load in the table, which could counteract the efficiency of the lookup.

### 2. **Precision Handling of Probabilities:**
   - Probabilities produced by LLMs are floating-point numbers, and the precision (many decimal places) can make it impractical to map each unique probability to a specific hash bucket without significant loss of information.
   - You'd likely need to quantize probabilities into bins, which would group tokens within a certain range. However, this can result in loss of granularity, especially when distinguishing between closely competing tokens.

### 3. **Binary Search and Sorted Structures:**
   - Instead of a hash table, a sorted structure like a **binary search tree** or a **heap** might be more efficient. These structures naturally allow for quick access to the highest probability element without needing to traverse all the elements.
     - A **max-heap** would allow you to retrieve the most probable token in **O(1)** time and adjust the structure in **O(log n)** after retrieval, where \(n\) is the number of tokens considered.
     - In contrast, iterating over all tokens in a hash table would take **O(n)** time even with an optimal lookup mechanism, since youâ€™d need to examine each probability bucket.

### 4. **Sampling from a Probability Distribution:**
   - LLMs often use techniques like **beam search** or **top-k** sampling, which restrict token candidates to the top-k probable tokens, making traversal of the full probability distribution unnecessary.
   - Another common method is **top-p sampling** (nucleus sampling), which selects tokens based on cumulative probability, thus reducing the need to traverse the entire token space. These methods already prioritize tokens with higher probabilities without iterating through the entire distribution.

### 5. **Space Complexity and Scalability:**
   - In a hash table, storing all tokens with normalized probabilities could have significant space overhead, particularly for large vocabularies (e.g., tens of thousands of tokens). If the LLM has a large vocabulary, the hash table or dictionary will require large amounts of memory to store each probability-token pair, potentially leading to inefficiency in terms of both time and space.
   - Since probability distributions for LLMs tend to be sparse (i.e., only a small number of tokens have non-negligible probabilities), creating a dense hash structure would lead to wasted space.

### 6. **Parallelization Opportunities:**
   - The sorting and traversal process could benefit from parallelization, especially in a system where multiple cores are available to process different segments of the probability distribution in parallel. In this case, hash tables or sorted structures could allow concurrent lookup operations across cores. However, this advantage is more apparent in tree-based or heap-based structures than hash tables, which would require some form of synchronization to maintain order.

### Conclusion:
While the idea of using a hash table or dictionary for normalized probabilities may seem appealing at first glance, practical considerations such as the continuous nature of probabilities, the sparsity of meaningful high-probability tokens, and the overhead of handling floating-point precision make alternative structures like max-heaps, binary trees, or more direct sampling strategies (e.g., top-k/top-p) more attractive in real-world implementations. In fact, most modern language models already employ sophisticated sampling and ranking strategies that focus computation only on the top portion of the probability space, avoiding the need for full iterations.

Thus, while not common in current LLM implementations, the idea of using an efficient lookup table for certain limited scenarios (e.g., coarse top-k approximations) could be explored as an experimental optimization, but existing methods such as heaps or beam search already address much of this need with high efficiency.

**Q:** Even after a beam search or a top p- or top k- sampling has been conducted, each token will have been visited and evaluated (perhaps in parallel), so rather than a binary search tree, and because hash tables might be memory and space intensive, what if a novel data structure were devised having the properties we desire ?

**A:** Designing a novel data structure for efficiently selecting the next token in a large language model after applying a beam search, top-k sampling, or top-p (nucleus) sampling would need to optimize several key aspects of performance: 

1. **Efficient access to the highest probability tokens.**
2. **Space efficiency, to avoid the high memory consumption of hash tables or binary trees.**
3. **Fast insertion and updating as tokens are processed.**

### Requirements for the Desired Data Structure:

- **Efficient traversal of probabilities**: The structure should allow near-constant time access to the most probable tokens.
- **Dynamic insertion/deletion**: Tokens and their probabilities are evaluated after the beam search or sampling methods, so the structure must efficiently handle updates to the set of candidate tokens as the search progresses.
- **Minimal space complexity**: It should avoid the overhead of typical tree or hash-based structures, especially since many tokens will have negligible or zero probability.
- **Precision handling**: The structure should accommodate the floating-point nature of the probabilities without losing precision in ranking tokens.

### Proposed Design Considerations:

#### 1. **Bucketized Skip List for Probabilities**:
   - **Skip List Overview**: A skip list is a probabilistic data structure that allows for fast search, insertion, and deletion, similar to balanced trees but with lower overhead. It consists of multiple linked lists layered on top of each other, where higher layers allow for faster traversal by skipping over large sections of the list.
   - **Bucketizing for Probabilities**: In this case, you could design a skip list where each level corresponds to a bucketized range of probabilities (e.g., probabilities between 0.9 and 1.0, between 0.8 and 0.9, and so on). Tokens with probabilities in each range would be linked together in a sorted manner. 
     - **Traversal**: You would begin traversal at the highest probability range (e.g., 1.00 to 0.90) and quickly skip over lower ranges until you find the next most probable token.
     - **Benefits**: The layered structure reduces the time complexity of finding the most probable token, while the bucketization keeps memory usage more manageable than a hash table, since tokens with low probabilities can be skipped quickly.

#### 2. **Segmented Heap**:
   - A **min-max heap** is a double-ended priority queue that allows access to both the minimum and maximum elements in constant time.
   - **Segmented Heap**: We could modify this concept by dividing the heap into segments, where each segment corresponds to a range of probabilities. Each segment would behave like a traditional max-heap, but each heap is limited to a specific range of probabilities.
     - **Dynamic Updates**: As tokens are inserted or updated, they would be placed into their corresponding heap segment based on their probabilities. This reduces the search space when looking for the highest-probability token.
     - **Efficiency**: By using a segmented heap, we limit the amount of data that needs to be rebalanced when a token's probability is updated or when a new token is inserted.

#### 3. **Probability Interval Tree**:
   - A **balanced interval tree** could be used to map ranges of probabilities to tokens. Each node in the tree represents a range (interval) of probabilities, and tokens with probabilities falling within that range are stored at that node.
   - **Dynamic Adaptation**: As token probabilities are updated, tokens can be rebalanced within the tree to maintain a balanced structure. The advantage is that once the search enters a specific probability range, you can efficiently traverse the tokens stored within that interval.
   - **Logarithmic Search Time**: This structure offers logarithmic search times for both finding the next token and for inserting/updating tokens as they are processed by beam search or sampling algorithms.

#### 4. **Compressed Probability Trie**:
   - A **probability trie** could be a novel approach, where each node represents a binary decision point in the probability range (e.g., each node corresponds to a split in the decimal points of the probability). 
   - **Trie Structure**: Tokens are stored as leaves in the trie, and navigating through the trie would correspond to progressively narrowing the probability range. For example, the first level of the trie could represent probabilities in the range [0.5, 1.0], and subsequent levels further subdivide this range (e.g., [0.75, 1.0], [0.875, 1.0], and so on).
     - **Search**: Once a token's probability has been quantized to a reasonable precision (say, 4 decimal places), searching for the next token involves traversing the trie until the highest probability token is found.
     - **Efficiency**: This structure would compress the space of probability values, allowing efficient lookup and traversal without needing to store every probability explicitly.

#### 5. **Priority Queue with Layered Sampling**:
   - You could combine a **priority queue** with a **layered sampling approach**. Each layer corresponds to a different probability threshold (e.g., probabilities > 0.9, between 0.8 and 0.9, etc.), and within each layer, tokens are stored in a priority queue based on their exact probability values.
   - **Layered Design**: The system could dynamically adjust the layer boundaries based on the current distribution of probabilities. For example, if most tokens have probabilities close to 0, the lower layers could contain more tokens, while higher layers remain sparsely populated.
   - **Benefits**: This structure would allow efficient sampling and token selection, with the priority queue handling intra-layer ranking while the layered design minimizes the overhead of searching low-probability tokens.

|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Bucketized Skip List**       | O(log n)                 | O(log n)                  | Moderate         | Moderate          |
| **Segmented Heap**             | O(log n)                 | O(1) for highest token    | Good             | High              |
| **Probability Interval Tree**  | O(log n)                 | O(log n)                  | Good             | High              |
| **Compressed Probability Trie**| O(log n)                 | O(log n)                  | Excellent        | Very High         |
| **Priority Queue with Layers** | O(log n)                 | O(1) within a layer       | Moderate         | Moderate          |

### Conclusion:
Each of these structures balances the trade-offs between **time complexity**, **space efficiency**, and **precision**. Depending on the exact requirements of your LLM pipeline (e.g., if you prioritize space savings over time complexity), one of these novel approaches may offer improvements over traditional binary search trees, heaps, or hash tables.

The **Compressed Probability Trie** and **Segmented Heap** appear to be particularly promising, offering efficient search times while keeping space complexity reasonable. These designs could handle the challenges of normalized probability spaces in large language models, allowing for faster token selection without the need to traverse the entire probability distribution.
